submission,AmazonFC,3,"My outbound dock is getting rid of fluid loading.For about a month now my dock has repurposed 6 of our fluid lanes to be palletize lanes. Last week, 3 of our palletize lanes were revamped from a single lane to a lane that comes down to a location where an associate then sorts it between 4 additional lanes.

My manager told everyone that it's only for the heavier palletize sorts; however, my friend in Sr Ops told me that our building is completely doing away with fluid loading, that we are to palletize everything on the dock, and it's so that we can sort it at the FC, and skip the sortation center before sending it to the delivery station.

My coworkers believe they're trying to phase out sort centers in general but I doubt that seeing as they just added robotics to some sort centers and that would seem like a waste of time and money.

Paraphrasing: it is a multidisciplinary work that focuses on achieving better results through increasing the satisfaction of the associates in the work environment.

I've been researching so much lately and with the global strikes on Prime Day, I can tell why they decided to reach universities for this kind of projects!

submission,AmazonFC,2,"Amazon Candidacy Next Steps.Hello all, 

I attended an Amazon hiring event this past Sunday, during which we were all told our mandatory orientation date would be 8/2, with training on either 8/5 or 8/6. We were also told we would receive emails confirming the specific time for the orientation session and providing access to the Mydocs paperwork.

Everything seemed pretty finalized, but yesterday I received the following email:

*It is time to schedule your first day of work with Amazon!* 

*Please visit www.amazon.com/candidatesupport in order to contact us to confirm your shift assignment and schedule your first day.*

*Thank you and we look forward to seeing you soon,*  
 *Amazon Staffing Team*   
 

I followed the instructions and called to confirm this info. I was told that no start date appointments were available and to call back over the weekend. I opted to try the chat option instead to see if I could clarify this step in the process. The person I chatted with actually confirmed my start date as 8/2 and said to wait for confirmation from hr. 

Great, I thought. Everything is back on track.

This morning, though,  I received the same email as above. I initiated another chat and this time the support operator told me that my assigned start date would be 8/9. I explained that yesterday it was confirmed for 8/2 and asked if that was ever processed. The response was simply ""no.""

Still unsure that anything was being assigned or confirmed, I called support and was told, once again, that no appointments are available and no start date could be assigned.

Has anyone else dealt with this process? It is quite different from how it was described at the hiring event. And I'm confused about why the chat is assigning appointments that are unavailable according to the phone support. I don't know if I just need to wait for email confirmation from hr, or I need to keep calling back every day to get an orientation date assigned.

submission,AmazonFC,3,"Questions about packing.Posted this in the other Amazon FC subreddit too. Still trying to get my bearings and appreciate any useful info.

1. What’s the right step to take when the chute (I think that’s the right word — I mean the cubby holes behind the packing station, where we grab the items for packing) doesn’t contain the right items for the current box? Sometimes the wrong items are there and the scanner says Overage, and other times there are no items there at all. What should I do in each of those cases?

2. Is there a quality rating for packers? What kinds of things can affect the quality of my work? If an order is missing items and I hit Problem on the keypad and select Missing Items, does that reflect badly on me? Does it count against the quality of my work? I don’t know what else I’m supposed to do, because I can’t pack a box if I don’t have the right items.

3. I’ve heard about Problem Solvers, but I haven’t encountered them yet. When would I expect to encounter them? Are they notified when I press the Problem button on the keypad?

4. What do I do if I get an S5 box with something like 15 items and the 15th item turns out to be the wrong one? So I’ve got this giant box that I can’t ship because I’m missing a single item. There’s nowhere to put it, so what do I do with the items? What’s the right step in that situation?

5. What is my rate supposed to be? I’ve looked online and I’ve seen all kinds of numbers for packers, from 100 to 700. I can’t imagine reaching 700. What type of rate should I be aiming for?

6. How do manangers communicate to individual associates about rate or quality issues? I’m trying to fix any potential quality issues now, but if something were to come up, how is that relayed to the associate? Through the A to Z website, email, or a phone call?

submission,AmazonFC,0,"A Thought on a Helpful Way to Help Amazon Workers.So I was one of the many people who watched the Last Week tonight episode on the rough conditions warehouse employees deal with, something I was familiar with beforehand hearing a lot from people I know who have worked at AFCs and the like. I know there was a big movement about boycotting amazon on prime day, but given some of the news reports, it didn't seem to stop them from hitting such high numbers anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

The point I bring this up, is I'm very much wanting to be an advocate for my fellow humans dealing with these sorts of struggles (I've been there, I feel your pain &lt;/3) and as a mostly powerless individual, there's not much I can do on my own, but occasionally I come up with ideas that could help and want to share this one to get the thoughts of the people who matter (you guys) to see if there's some worth to it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my idea was, what was something that people could do, without having to set the bar of boycotting, which from a purely practical perspective, only goes so far. Thus I thought, what about if people started writing messages in the gift notes field of the order options, with messages addressed to the floor managers or staff in some way with supporting messages? I know they get printed on those order slips that get included in the packages, so I feel like there some chance it might be seen or noticed by the individuals in the warehouses, and I'm thinking if they start showing up en-masse it would definitely catch some attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

Companies tend to be rather susceptible to massive noise about them, and it's not exactly favorable noise to Amazon if that noise is about their working conditions, and is being created within their very own warehouses. The boycott did make some noise, but their prime numbers made more. This, I feel has worth, because it can potentially be just as noisy as whatever their business numbers is, far outpacing noise generated by a boycott (hopefully I worded this in a way that makes sense). 

Also while I admit, there is a certain hypocrisy to giving your money to a company you are complaining about, I also am just trying to look at this from a practical perspective, that it's just really freaking hard to impact their bottom lines and a lot of people, might not have viable options anymore to acquire certain things otherwise, be it health reasons that limit their ability to leave the house, remote location, the loss of brick and mortar stores, having to work too many jobs to have the time to run errands, etc. 

For those people and anyone else who has a reason to order from Amazon regardless, whether or not I or someone else feels its a justifiable reason, the fact remains this could catch on simply because it makes doing an act of kindness really easy for a lot of people, and maybe I'm overly optimistic, but I feel like it has some potential to cause change.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"packing here is not like packing a personal item to your grandma.Honestly I did have trouble at first with packing at Amazon because I would always think that it was like packing a personal item. No. All the items here are replaceable. Worst case scenario, the box opens up at USPS and the item is lost. Okay. They can send a replacement. That's probably not going to happen either. If it opens at all, it will probably open sooner. It's probably still Amazon carrying the item so they can take it to problem solve. 

I do things that I would never do with a personal item. I will tape the box shut even if it's bulging out, if I can get the tape on. It doesn't really matter because if it opens, it's still Amazon there. They can fix it. I've never had any complaint about this.

I've never had a manager or PA come to me and complain about dunnage either. You should put some amount of dunnage since they want you to do that, but often dunnage is useless unless you fill up the box completely. If you put three little bags of air in, it doesn't do anything in a big box. But no one cares about this. So just put some amount of dunnage to satisfy their requirement. I guess, just pull once on the dunnage machine, and that's it?

Complaints range from mild annoyance to full on anger at the wholesale interruption of their process to dismiss a message from their screen so they can continue processing.

After receiving multiple complaints I finally was able to observe one of these messages in person. I looked up the sender and discovered they are a Data Analyst in my FC, which tells me that they’ve found a way to pull rates for every associate, generate personalized messages for each individual, and send them out en masse.

And if you're a blue vest at an FC or even higher up, it would be really nice to hear about times you've been to a DS, it'd be pretty interesting as well as help people understand more about the differences.

I’m front half, so the best time for me to leave is weekend after next. I tried doing an internal transfer last month and none of them were accepted. And I can’t this month because I’m leaving the facility before the applications would be done processing. So I go to HR to help.

They send out an email to the closest warehouse about a hardship transfer. Nothing happens.

HR guy finds a number for the warehouse. I call using the HR desk’s phone. The first time I reach a real person, they hang up on me. The second time, I get this lady who really is trying her best but is no help at all. She says that she understands my situation but to try to use the internal transfer system anyway. She also says to reach out to my local HR team for help...

After 15 minutes of this, I hand the phone to the HR guy only for him to find out that wasn’t the HR at the other warehouse at all- it was ERC. So he calls the number again, knowing that it’s gonna go to the ERC, and ask them for the warehouse number. They give him the number he dialed.

He dials the number for warehouse security, and they inform him the HR desk at the other warehouse has no phones.

They say they’ll ask HR there to reach out to him as soon as possible.

A few days later, he calls back and asks for the login ID for the head of HR and reaches out to them directly through chat. And they left him on read.

And this is where we are. I feel like this is more his fight then mine at this point, but overall, this is the most frustrating and ridiculous situation I’ve ever been in.

I'm not sure why I didn't cross my mind when I applied, but I have carpal or ulnar tunnel in my right arm/wrist/elbow. It's not diagnosed, but I'm 98% certain it's one of those. 

It's not constant. Only flares up when I do repetitive motions. I'm only 26, but it's probably because I worked in tech/customer support for 5 years and did a lot of typing. I also play piano/guitar, and I drove for Uber for a year. A lot of arm/wrist movements. Holding the steering wheel caused it to flare up from time-to-time, but a wrist brace helped a bit. 

Anyways, on my fourth day (two days ago) it started to really flare up. The joints in my finger, and my wrist are killing me. The pain is also starting to shoot up through my elbow and shoulder, and it especially hurts at night when trying to sleep.

I'm going to try using my wrist brace and take advantage of the health insurance by seeing a chiropractor.  

I definitely don't want to ignore it by popping ibuprofen every day. 

Is it worth talking to one of my managers about this? I'm assuming I'll need a doctors note of some sort?

Are there any positions they might be willing to assign me to that has less repetitive wrist/grabbing motions?

I also am interviewing for other jobs, but took the one at Amazon for the time being. Take a break from being in the car all day and also get health insurance.

Anyways, this job has been taking a huge toll on my mental and physical health. I struggle with mild depression, anxiety, and disordered eating. I also have wrist pain (never saw a doc but it’s likely carpal tunnel).

My mind has been going down the rabbit whole my entire 10hr shift. Not having any music or podcast to distract me doesn’t help. Combined with working the overnight shift and not having any windows, my depression and anxiety has exacerbated. I haven’t been fueling my body properly either due to my f’d up relationship with food.

My wrist has also gotten really bad over the last couple weeks. I went to AmCare and they basically said I’m SOL. There are no jobs in the warehouse they could assign me to as a new hire that would be less movements with my wrist.

Over the past week I have depleted all my personal and unpaid time off - leaving after lunch last several shifts in a row.

I knew I wasn’t going to make it through tonight, and I also have a major job interview in the morning that I wouldn’t need get enough sleep for if I worked my overnight.

Knowing I’d get terminated since I have 0hrs UPT and no PTO, I decided it’d be better to resign. So I did that  using the option in the AtoZ portal. I put my last day as today - with the intention of not going in tonight.

I've been working at an AR-FC for just over 3 months now in AFE, and I've noticed a lot of newer hires (and people who generally have terrible rates) are being cross trained more frequently than anyone else.

We keep being told it's all about who has the highest rates (I'm usually in the top 3 packers, and top 5 rebiners every shift, but I keep getting told to wait to train on other roles)

Is there a set way AM's follow in choosing who to cross train, or is it just a matter of who sucks up the most?

(Our FC has a lot of eastern European managers/leads, and almost all the staff receiving cross training/inclining are also eastern Europeans. Would this be a big factor?)

Salaried folks.I’ve seen so many posts about how people advise against career progression to AM/OM due to no overtime pay, crazy hours, and that a PA will pull in more after factoring in OT pay. Maybe my FC GM runs things differently?

This is an informal process (ie not tracked in Kronos/atoz), but I have a solid GM at my FC who manually tracks management (salaried) overtime and gives us banked time off in lieu of OT pay at a 50% ratio (ie 50 hours of overtime = 25 hours in lieu time off). He has the AGM and OMs track their respective managers OT in spreadsheets and allows us to take the time within three months. Nothing is changed on our schedule or AtoZ, and no official PTO is used, but on a regularly scheduled day they would have us take the day off and just leave it in system as time worked.

Do any other AMs+ (or other salaried roles) have a site GM that runs such a process?

If I get fired, I will probably stop eating and drinking until my body gives out on life*. 

A bit of back story. I don't know why I joined Amazon, I guess I was attracted by the pay. I spent the last four years working in office based environments, working in Financial Services and then Customer Care in Concentrix. I lost my full time job as a Disputes Analyst for a bank after my ex called the police on me and I was arrested at my workplace (this is not really relevant to Amazon related stuff but this all happened weeks after our son was born and she cheated on me and I subsequently altered her social media login so she couldn't then text her fling). 

Anywho, I was picked up by a shining light at another firm Concentrix in November of last year, who took me on despite my conviction (now spent). I left this same firm earlier this year to try my hand as a Bus Driver having subsequently quit that job in August due to my mental health being affected and I was too honest with the managers about this, thus risked being investigated by the DVLA. I rejoined the Concentrix firm in August and left again last month to persue higher pay at Amazon - firmly gluing the door at Concentrix shut.

Amazon has no job security and I have been relentlessly applying for jobs. ""When will they fire me"" is what I sleep at night and think about at daytime. My rate fluctuates from 140 - 190 uph on a daily basis. One time stowing three yellow totes of books, I managed to his 412 uph. I don't really look at TOT but sometimes it says 17.29s or 24 something, no idea what this means. 

I was off the first week on the job after an Achilles tendinitis injury and arguing idiotically with my GP to not take six weeks off as I couldn't afford it. I just finished my second week with lower back pain. I have been told by multiple employees that I am ""safe"" for the first month.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"Amazon to open a Delivery Station in Albuquerque?I remember a month or two ago there was a job posting on Amazon's website about a Delivery Station opening in Albuquerque for a position.  The posting has since been removed.

I wonder, does anyone have any info.  Albuquerque seems to be one of the last major cities without significant Amazon presence (only Whole Foods pretty much).  If they are really opening a Delivery Station in Albuquerque, I wonder where would it feed from considering there are no Fulfillment or Sortation Centers in Albuquerque or anywhere in New Mexico.  Currently packages from the Phoenix area are mainly sorted through PHX8 and are delivered via USPS in Albuquerque, while packages from elsewhere mainly ship UPS.  A Delivery Station I think would need a Sortation Center to feed in packages, and PHX8 alone won't bring in enough volume due to the distance.",1,-1,t2_qbjgzy9,dk9fyk,Not found,t5_1387r9,1571517932,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/dk9fyk/amazon_to_open_a_delivery_station_in_albuquerque/

submission,AmazonFC,9,"YYZ7 just gave all BHN associates a raise to $19.25 until end of year.So YYZ7, a 1.2m sq ft sortable FC that launched on Sep 22 in Toronto, has been having difficulty onboarding full time staff for the back half nights shifts in various departments. As a result, they just introduced a $3 seasonal premium differential which is also backdated for all current BHN associates, bringing regular full time BHN folks to a regular hourly rate of $18.75/hr +$0.50/hr night shift premium from Oct 13-Dec 28 for peak.

All other regular full time associates make $15.75 + $0.50 premium if on night shift.

The $3 increase only applies to BHN; not donut nights, FHN, or BHD.

I want to switch, but they offer no guarantee that you can switch back to your current schedule (I’m FHN) in the new year - only that it’s based on what will be available on AtoZ for internal transfers at that time.

Anyone heard of individual shift only premiums like this before?

I contacted local HR (The person I got in touch with is hard to deal with) and she said that there is no way I could be rehired at any Amazon since I quit ""In lieu of termination"" even though my manager said it would have only been a warning!

submission,AmazonFC,3,"Questions about IOL and Problem Solve.Hi everyone, I'm posting this for my husband  because he has some questions regarding IOL and Problem Solve. He has been working at a facility in Ohio for going on three years now, and since joining this group, his suspicions have grown that things aren't run the same there as at pretty much every other Amazon facility. Since he started working for Amazon, he has been assigned to Inbound Stow, overnight, Monday through Thursday, 6pm to 4:30am. There has been a pretty steady turnover of management and PAs since he started working there as well. Two years ago the Area Manager selected him to start doing IOL and he and one other person rotated nights doing IOL and bin audits. When the PA at the time had to go on leave with her child, the area manager had my husband train to be the temporary PA and he filled in for about four months every day, then another two months off and on, as she only came back one or two days a week to start. When she returned, he went back to doing IOL, then was asked to learn Problem Solve, along with the other IOL person, they both trained at the same time. When that area manager transferred out of state, the new person who was hired came straight out of college and came in and started letting anyone who asked take a ""turn"" doing Problem Solve, even people who had just recently started at Amazon. I notice that most of you have mentioned that in order to do Problem Solve at your location, you have to go through an application process and be hired into the position. This is not the case in Columbus. Recently the PA left and a new one was brought in from the street, no Amazon experience at all. Now several more new people are expressing interest in Problem Solve and my husband has been asked to teach them how to do it, he gives them them a night worth of training, then he gets stuck stowing. Around 3am, when Problem Solve has cages backed up into the isles, they ask him to go help get it ""caught up"" and he ends up being there until 5:30-6am while the person who started out with Problem Solve leaves right at 4:30 on the dot. Part of the reason they can't do very good is that it's not a job someone can learn in only a few hours, it turns out to be way more work and way more difficult than they expected and because they don't have the permissions to fix a lot of the issues, so they just stack things up in bins for someone else to fix. No one MAKES my husband stay late, sometimes they ASK him to, other times he does it without being asked because of his own work ethic, he doesn't feel right going off leaving a mess for the person coming in on day shift to have to deal with on top of doing their own job. Over the summer, management decided to have only day shift do IOL, now this past Monday they told my husband that they needed him to do IOL because it has to be done on both shifts again. The other guy who used to rotate days with him doing IOL and Problem Solve recently transferred to a new warehouse just outside of Columbus. IOL was pretty piled up from one person just not having time to get all of it done in a shift, but he has it finally caught up tonight. Now the manager tells him that some of the new people are interested in learning IOL (they don't like Problem Solve so much anymore since they figured out that it's actually WORK). Again, these people have worked there maybe three months at best. He is getting extremely tired of basically training people to replace him, then having to go back to stow, until they mess up and can't do the job, or get tired of it and decide they don't want to do it anymore, then he has to work extra hard to bail them out while they go home and decide what they want to try next. He was beginning to get extremely frustrated with Amazon in general until lately I've been reading on here when people on have  mentioned applying for Problem Solve positions. Is Problem Solve something that someone should have to apply for and get hired to do only Problem Solve if he/she is qualified? Or do people just ask and get shown a little bit and management puts them in the ""rotation"" in order to be ""fair""? Recently a warehouse opened just south of Columbus that stores larger items, should he maybe try to apply for a Problem Solve or PA position at a totally different facility? He knows people who have come from the facility in Etna and he knows that he doesn't want to work there. There is also a Delivery Station I think it's called in downtown where all the Amazon vans come and go from. Do those facilities have PAs and Problem Solve? It just seems that things don't work like they should where he is now and he and the other senior employees are getting pushed out by this little clique that all came with the new PA. Instead of being rewarded for hard work, management believes in ""taking turns"" and letting anyone who asks do whatever they want while the senior employees have to do the beginner jobs unless they have to go bail someone out who decided that they don't actually like having to do the work that goes with the other positions. Any advice or suggestions would be awesome. He's just getting tired, frustrated and burned out, starting to feel like he will never get an opportunity to advance within the company as long as he is at this facility. He has even considered completely leaving Amazon for six months, then applying for a PA position as an outside applicant because he feels he would have a far better chance at actually getting the job. Hard work, good work ethic and teamwork definitely don't work in someone's favor at the location where he is currently.

During the shift, I and the other PA's get MANY request that if they start offering VTO's would we let them know. The issue that I see is that it's just an unorganized free for all, the managers come on the radio, ""I need 10 VTO's"" (this happens multiple times throughout the shift), and at least for me I want anyone that came to me to get their vto, just like assume the other PAs want as well. But a lot of people that want them or honestly NEED them for whatever reason don't get them because either the PAs sent their vto people to the manager first, or the manager giving the vtos happens to be within a closer walking distance of other people that want them, there is a bunch of other reasons why people that ask for them aren't able to get them but this post is already long.

Are they actually reusing packages that are used to keep the numbers up and keep associates in shape and prepared for peak ?

1. what officially counts as a 'product' set? (e.g. you have 2 items in pod bin, one is a shampoo set of 2 'wrapped' and another single item. you count 2 and the scanner beeps 'wrong answer friend, try again.""

\- can this be assumed that someone mis-counted AND what is procedure to follow? if AndOn is to be followed, what is the correct 'error' choice from list to use?

1a. same scenario, EXCEPT shampoo set is NOT wrapped PLUS another item (say it's a gift certificate) AND scanner sez it is not 3 items.

1b.  does it count against you if you incorrectly punch in wrong count the first time, FOR WHATEVER REASON because 

there are many (inadvertently punched the wrong number on scan gun.)v, but you know with 100% certainty, that on second try, the answer is absolutely correct.

2. i asked someone here about there being some kinda ""guidelines to follow re: IC/QA procedures"" and was told you could find it on AMAZON's internal servers that you can access only on-site.  is this correct?

3.  i don't know how well i am doing. no one really is telling me anything as to if i am too slow, or rather, if i am doing the job as quickly or as efficiently as i should. i do know that 2 of the 5 i have started with in my group no longer work in IC/QA or are somewhere else, or were let go or ?  the other thing i know is one of the 4 in my group, on the third day, was taken off his/her station halfway thru a shift, and was re-assigned to help work with 'water-spiders' on another floor. tbh, don't know what the situation with that was, whether it was voluntary or whatever. i hope this isn't AMAZON's way of telling someone they aren't fit to be a 'picker'.  like i said, i don't know the entire story.

4. can anyone recommend a pair of shoes that helps relieve pain to the front part (metatarsal?) balls-o-the-feet?

   5. i know i have only been here 3 days but that position called ""problem solve"" seems like something i would be i

interested in doing. do i talk to my PA about that?  is this something you can only do after doing other amazon 'positions' for many months before you can even consider being considered for?

submission,AmazonFC,1,"Messed up on something and I’m freaking out.I’m a new Manager in the DS section of Amazon. We have a daily audit we do for validating all trucks are TDR’d. I made a clerical error and passed our audit when one door required a shift change because it wasn’t Dock Lock Engaged. 

Issue is, essentially every shift missed this. I was not informed of the need for a shift change from any of the previous shifts nor manager. I completely forgot about the fact that it required a shift change for being Dock Lock Not Engaged, because the specific door does not have one to begin with and normally has a vendor load in it.

I’m freaking out right now, I’ve worked really hard to finally make it to this level and TDR misses are usually what get you fired, this was a clerical miss on myself and essentially all shifts but I gave the OK on it being fine. I know to take responsibility on it for where I messed up, because I did. I just didn’t even think about that form because I have almost never had that door TDR’d, as it’s normally used by a vendor and not by associates. Vendor loads do not need to be TDR’d as it’s the vendor who handles it.

I checked all stuff was there, all spots were checked and that the cone was in front of the trailer. Moved slightly to the left but not as it forgotten situation, so I pushed it in a little.

I’m essentially going to call our current site lead in the morning and let him know my mistake and how it came to be, which was pretty much we never do a “dock check” per shift as our handoff, but I take the responsibility on the miss I made as it’s completely importance.

I just don’t think I can take being let go emotionally, because of everything I’ve done to make it here. DS section of Amazon is not as sever, and it was not a TDR miss as in I messed up a truck, but it was an audit error on my end because the back of my mind with that specific vendor and door is “oh we don’t work that truck, it’s a vendor load.”. Because of this miss though I’m just completely terrified right now and can’t sleep.

From what I see in this sub, it is mostly FCs I see and not DS, so the answer may be different and unsure if other L4s ever had this issue or know someone who had a clerical miss.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"The hell is wrong with the organization.So I work at a fulfillment center, and it seems that the only way, to contact ANYONE is to physically go to work, get through the security and to the HR section located in the warehouse.

There is no email address, no phone number, no website/forum/app. It's like I have found myself in the 19th century or something. It is in complete dichotomy to how it works customer side.

last time I worked I asked for my shift plan, which I wanted through email but HR couldn't even send it to my email, they can only print it out, ridiculous but fair enough, I get the shift-plan, but as it turns out, it is wrong (for the wrong year), so I go there again, but now they were closed, I thought I could get it done from home from the provided phone number, but as that turns out, that number doesn't have any access to any information (and 10 minute wait time on top of that) So to know whether I should go to work tomorrow, I have to go to work tomorrow (6 am) , and back to the HR, and upon entering the security area, even if I am not meant to work that day, I HAVE TO stay the whole shift, as I am now working ""overtime"" (it's unpaid of-course) and have to finish the shift.

I have no idea how I am meant to submit sick notes or anything either, as all support suddenly disappears when you get employed (10 phone calls a day, a 24/7 quick hotline, email and a website for when you are in the process to get hired, which all disappears when you do actually sign the contract lol)

After a pre-shift sync, the Ops Manager pulled me to the side and told me that she was taking me to HR to have me be reverted to a Tier I, and asked if had UPT to cover the day because she was going to send me home. This was my first 1:1 conversation with her. I was just placed on a PIP. 

I should mention I am not the only person she is targeting, as there are multiple other associates and one area manager who is going thru this as well. Associates that have gone to HR are told there is nothing that can be done, and the rest are too scared to report their experiences. But anyways..

The feedback she gave me was as follows:

* *I am unreliable because I do not answer chime* \- I answer all other chimes. I put in group chat if I am away from my laptop. she had sent me one chime the day before that said ""hey (my name)"" 
* *I am not a part of the team because I do not attend sync* \- I explained I missed sync because I was water-spidering where there are no visible clocks, and lost track of time. nobody radioed me to remind me it was happening, either.
* *The ""small tasks"" that I have been give, I cannot even do those right* \- I complete all tasks given to me, even before the managers start their portions, and I have received no performance feedback from any manager on shift, or ops. 
* *I do not want to be a Process Assistant* \- I asked to stow for the first time one day due to personal medical issues, as I did not want to affect my performance on the floor in my role. Because I choose not to disclose this information and not give her a satisfactory reason, she sees this as me not wanting to do the job at all. 

After, I spoke with managers I have known since before transferring out, not mentioning the situation, and asked them for feedback on my performance and any opportunities for improvement. None of them had a negative thing to say.

The warehouse recently mass hired over 40+ new stowers on forklifts. The new stowers overpack the bins making it dangerous to pick from. I’ve rejected 2 picks last week and 1 pick this week because I swear I could’ve had my head crushed with how many items they crammed in there especially at the lower levels.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"Picking too fast?I didn’t think it was actually possible, but during my last shift a PA come up to me asked me to stand-down. Everyone else was still picking. He said run to the bathroom whatever you need to do real quick and comeback with a broom. When I was walking away from my station I noticed hella totes backed up on the MRC. When I came back from my fresh air diversion I noticed that totes were no longer backed up. I ended up showing a week 2 picker how to stack totes on the side and continue picking when the conveyor or ARSAW gets jammed. About 10 minutes later I was told to pick again. PA told me at the end of the day that I was top picker all day in the building an had to stand me down as we were pushing the MRC too hard. My rate actually kept getting higher as the day continued, presumably due to everyone else slowing down and leaving early with whatever PTO they have thus making more pods available to me, My final hour takt was at 5.97s with 560UPH., with the rest of the day at 6.668. 

So does this happen to other people in the same or different roles with being too productive sometimes? What are other good ways to use time being told to stand down? Since I’m sbc trained one time during a time when all pickers were asked to stand down I grabbed a hand scanner and started grinding through my sbc curve.

I am a stower at an Amazon FC.  I was working for a while on a final (3rd) write-up (for productivity), doing fine for a little over a month.  It was set to expire in late December.  Then on the last day of my shift for the week, I was sent down to HR by a manager, where they informed me that I was up for termination due to not making rate last week.  I decided to appeal, and will meet with the general manager tomorrow afternoon.  

I don't really know if I have much of a case, so I thought I would ask here on reddit.

On the appeal form, it appears that they were supposed to have given me the chance to appeal when I was given my final write-up, but it was just verbal.

So long story short, my doctor was recently arrested and I can no longer get the medication I've been taking for the past 6 years as of November 7th. The same month I start a backbreaking job with Amazon, happens to be the same month I all of a sudden stop getting my meds and have to go through hell. I've been going to work late everyday this week, but planning on going on time from now on starting next shift and try to just suck it up and deal with my withdrawals from my medication. My attendance points should be at a 4.0 right now, but everyday it keeps showing that I have 0 points. I've been using this to my advantage because I honestly feel terrible without my meds, and I would have never been late if the laws didn't decide what's best for patients over my doctor and then blasting him all over the news. So, I was wondering, is this just a glitch? Why don't I have any points on my record? Is it just showing in their end but not in my end? I'm pretty sure it's automated so I highly doubt it's someone forgetting to add the points. My partner is an ambassador/amnesty at my building and told me not say a thing about it to HR, because that might just be my biggest mistake and they could ""fix it"" by adding up all my points. But yeah, so I don't know if one day this will just fix itself anyway and generate the points, or if I've gotten away with showing up late all these times? If so I thank god because I really haven't been feeling well. I'm hoping the system has just forgotten about adding up points, and not to where I have all the points but somehow not showing up on my atoz.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"Is blue badge conversion even possible during peak? Especially if they over-hired?I started in September of this year as a seasonal full-time (40 hours) associate in a FC. I am ICQA (counting) and am not cross trained in anything. VTO came in like crazy from late October to mid November. Counters were constantly out of work, so I was just standing there most of the time. I took some VTO. I’ve worked enough to earn 5 hours personal time off. Beginning of November I put in my application to convert to blue badge so I can keep my job after peak. It was recommended by a blue badge. So far I’ve gotten two emails from recruiting ops: one a week ago saying it will be reviewed, and one today saying I’m still in the running for the conversion but it’s taking awhile because they’re finalizing the hiring need for peak. My center over-hired, which is causing a stall in work and a fight to get supplies/scanners before shifts. They’re always training and giving people VTO so there’s work for the learning curve employees. So is it even possible, with so many white badges employed, to be converted during peak season? I have 0 attendance points (never been late, never left early unless I took VTO) and no write ups. My rate for cycle count is above the average rate. I’ve spoken to HR and all they say is it will come, but maybe in the new year.

I'm working out of Problem Solve and my chime/radio is being blown up. All everyone could get out was ""hazmat lane 5"". So I grab my go cart and head over.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"2 months working at Amazon (The story so far).


I remember it like it was yesterdy. I got laid off the week before and I couldn't find a job to save my life. In a frantic effort to find employment, I found myself on the Amazon careers website. I filled out my application and scheduled my interview for the next day. Once I was hired, I spent almost every waking hour combing through the endless reviews on Glassdoor and YouTube. I was terrified of what awaited me on the other side of that metal detector.

 I've been working at An Amazon FC for a little over 2 months now and let me say, I was wrong. I thought Amazon was this legalized sweatshop hellhole that was described online. It's actually quite the opposite. They literally give you all of the ingredients to success at Amazon. You just gotta use em correctly. Fcs, you can basically leave whenever you want and come back the next day like it's nothing. All you need to do is give one hour advanced notice. If you have the UPT/PTO for it go for it. A main theme I see in these 'horror stories' is people not wanting to be held accountable for their own actions. When I first started work, i was that guy. If I got called out for missed scans or for scanning in late from my break, my first reaction was to get mad and blame everything else even though its my fault. If you got fired it's because you fucked up. It's simple. I like that. Unions make it to easy. I want to be held accountable for my actions like a real adult.

My husband has worked for Amazon for 2 1/2 years as a Warehouse Associate in Columbus, Ohio and has been working in Problem Solve and IOL almost exclusively for a little over a year now. Curr he is the only overnight person trained in IOL and also has more permissions than the other Problem Solve people, so he's been going between the two doing 55 hour weeks since October 1. Last summer the PA went on leave and he was asked by the area manager to fill in for her until she returned, which he did for six weeks. Last Wednesday he was approached by someone from HR and a manager and told that a PA position is opening for a shipping location about three miles from where he currently works. I'm not exactly sure what it's called, but it's much smaller than the warehouse and is where the same day delivery items are loaded every day. He was told that he should definitely apply because of his experience and qualifications. He started to fill out the application part after work on Friday, but he also needs a resume. My question (asking for him) is does anyone have a good suggestion for how to explain that he temporarily worked as PA during that time last summer? The area manager who asked him to do the job has recently transferred to Florida, but he can still contact him on Chime, should he also ask him for a recommendation? Are there any other suggestions?

The requirements list proficiency in a modern programming language (Ruby, Python, Java, C#). Is there a language that is particularly prevalent for this type of work, or what is the existing code primarily written in? My past experience is in C++ and I have dabbled in Python over the years. I currently work in problem solve and there are an absurd amount of tools we use, and even more outdated defunct ones (I'm imagining lots of spaghetti code).

submission,AmazonFC,1,Season Employee Termination.I was recently sent out of work early on a Thursday due to a medical emergency. I was in the hospital from Thurs to Sat night. I put in my medical time off and it stated to be sure to turn in my doctors notes. Evidently I was sent an email from HR on Fri night stating that I needed to reach out to them by 10:30 am on Sat morning. I was in the hospital and couldn’t respond to that email. I wrote an email back on Sunday and explained what had happened but never heard back from the gentleman in HR. I tried to log in to A to Z and realized I couldn’t do so. On Monday morning I contacted ERC and explained what was going on and they stated that the process had started for my termination. They submitted a ticket for someone in my warehouse hr to contact me but said that it could take up to 2 days for them to contact me. Remind you there is NO contact number for anyone at our warehouse so all I could do was wait. In the meantime I reached out via email over and over to the gentleman that is over our HR and he would never respond. Finally 2 days later at 8:30 at night someone contacted me and stated they was from hr but refused to give me his name. He said I would need to make sure I have all doctors notes for the days that I was out which I told him I have and then he proceeded to say am I sure that since I was out with a medical emergency was I sure I could perform the job still and I told him yes I had already been medically cleared to return to work. Right after that he hung up on me and I called back 3 times and I have not heard anything at all and I also emailed them again.

I’m in a delivery station, I’ve been on the on road team as an L3 for the past 6 months but starting Sunday I’m going back to OPs (still L3) to help run MCO/load out. A few months ago MCO was having troubles, and I went from dispatching our drivers, straight over to MCO to help stow down. Getting used to the 4 high Vs the 3 high was an embarrassment. Miss sort queen over here!! And the OV racks, they’re falling apart! The one floor “shelf” is struggling to handle the weight.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"Packers/Pickers, is this an opinion piece?Former FC Associate at CLE3 (newly launched). It's joke on top of joke, scare tactic on top of scare tactic, trick on top of trick. It's high school amplified, spliced with tone-deaf, faulty management who have two left feet. It's back to back days of permissive parenting, followed by 30 seconds of idle threats to spank the unruly kids with a switch then mom and dad slam the door and return to selfishly smoking their NSFW crack pipe, so to speak. 

It's the modern day version of old skool, easy to get welfare. Word of mouth has led many heavily pregnant ladies to sign up for that generous 'first day' benefits package and they work for less than a month. The FC is situated in a dilapidated, disadvantaged no man's land, exploiting those who live nearest, filling them with false hope and creating a wicked long commute for those who could lend some healthy balance down on the warehouse floor. 

The racial imbalance is glaring, over 90% of the higher-ups are college educated/military trained Causcasians plucked from cozy security. They're talking sheep who grossly mislead you. They love to lull you into dreamland with visions of upward movement within the warehouse, knowing full well such a path is littered with enormous hurdles without a college degree or sacrificing your entire home life for multiple years.

It's totally damaging to a future career elsewhere. Amazon preys on this Generation Y instant Mogul mentality, during Q&amp;A's Stock Shares in Amazon is all the rage. The politics of advancement is a freakishly warped rung, not in line with any normal course up the ladder of success. The whole system is a big joke, it teaches you to play social games and to fall for their silly tricks without ever honing the necessary tools and talents to rise above unskilled laborer.

They trick you with incentives to GO FASTER, like winning prizes during Peak Season, or promising an instant promotion to Learning Ambassador if you consistently hit rate, cross-train and demonstrate your schmooze-fest, bootlicking, lying, manipulating, con-artist abilities. Compromising all sense of morality and honest hard work.

Becoming a Learning Ambassador tricks you into staying longer than you'd ordinarily would. None of these jobs are rocket science, the only reason they have Learning Ambassador's is because the turnover rate of burned out, terminated employee's is high, so they're constantly needing to train new people, so if there was a massive culling of weak ones, at least Amazon still has the duped Learning Ambassador fools on hand.

And funnily enough it's the LA's who often cause people to quit because every new hire aims for Learning Ambassador, they witness how the LA's laze about and conversate all day. This is the newbies biggest inspiration, their main goal is to NOT WORK... ahhh... \*wish granted\* and before you know it, there are 10-15 LA's milling around doing nothing, upsetting and severely affecting the morale of those busting their butts off. Tho Amazon doesn't care to fix this and provide a fair and reasonable breather for the ones steadily pushing out product, cuz there will just be another crop of poor unsuspecting suckers waiting to get in the door. Bezos is Genius indeed!

Fast rate, affable personality, pro-actively petition for other positions, team player, good attendance, safety conscious -- Ideally these are supposed to be a solid chunk of qualities that get you recognized to be promoted to Learning Ambassador, Problem Solver, etc. However in reality it's a mixed bag. The slower, older folks will get rewarded with easier, relaxed tasks, I guess cuz Amazon feels pressured to somehow make them fit in, as to avoid any discrimination issues. 

Overt favoritism takes precedence over rate, buddy nominating buddy so they have someone to chat with and not die of boredom while doing loads of nothing all day. Abrasive, dirty, rotten characters.... giggly, hyper people wrapped up in convo who recklessly turn quickly, or snail crawling zombies, social club gatherer's or horny fella's performing mating rituals who clog up the aisles impeding your job and affecting your rate, or non-team players who don't bother to pitch in and lend various forms of support like simply picking up a fallen errant object, somehow these awful types managed to get promoted. Plus there's obvious age/race/gender balances that the brass strive for to make Amazon look good on paper. If you got one white boy, you need one white girl, like Noah's Ark.  

It's the upside-down, where the rough and gruff, shiftless, illiterate, apathetic, authority-hating Fonzie's massage the jukebox until it spins in their favor, becoming the Teacher's Pet, who now think they're super cool and can skip school legitimately. Meanwhile... the sweet, polite, observant, detail orientated, note-taking, attentive, punctual, dependable, studious, industrious Richie's get shoved in a meat locker and mowed down by a hog.

Mindlessly race to get the fastest rate and kiss up majorly, then within two weeks get pulled from the floor, leaving the less productive ones there. Get rewarded with a long protracted pit stop as Learning Ambassador, where you drink the Kool-Aid and turn into a sloth with a rapid decline in work ethic, and a big boost in arrogance and pridefulness. Yet you are in charge of nothing, you make no important decisions, you have no real credentials, you are merely a deluded messenger who can't see the writing on the wall of how stupid and backwards this is, and will likely lead nowhere.  

I swear, if I ran a business and a potential hire came in with 'Amazon Learning Ambassador' on their resume, I'd chuck that thing right in the trash and I'd encourage all other establishments to do the same. Altho, there are a couple of exceptions, those who feel a little embarrassed and uneasy about it, like they really didn't do much to deserve it and cringe at the thought of shade being thrown their way, so they approach it with grace and gratitude, while others become smug, self-entitled, sluggish, uncaring, tactless, dismissive, bored, gossiping knuckleheads who try to shirk their thimble-full of responsibilities at every turn.

There is NOTHING ""fun"" about this hellhole. Fun is had only by those who have more energy in their mouths than in their bodies. Fun is had only by those who seek out every non-work related distraction to entertain themselves. Fun is had only by those in the first 4 weeks when rate doesn't count. Or by those with poor time management, taking too many mini vacay's. Too much fun equals positive reviews from FORMER EMPLOYEE'S who now regret indulging in all the fun to counteract all the inherent negativity within and miss their dumb fun friends and their paycheck.

CLE3 is a hotspot for Alien Abductions, people mysteriously disappear in droves. The Martians musta built their nest there, rudely probing the humans until it hurts their heart and crushes their soul. Chewed up and spat out by these space monsters, the human's empty shells are then fashioned into fancy, colorful jewelry to sell on Amazon.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"Vent/Rant about our PAs and AMs.So I'm in pack right, and our peak rate is 220/hr which is already difficult enough to meet cause our waterspiders disappear for hours and we have no supplies and because some of our rebinners decide to just toss items all over the place instead of where they actually belong (which I don't understand how this is even possible, there's a whole flashing light telling you where to pop the item into). Anywho, our AM decided that we weren't supposed to miss out items (guessing cause our miss rate was probably pretty high last week with walls being a whole mess). This no missing out is such bs cause instead we then have to find a PA who are normally hiding all over the place which makes us spend several minutes between our last scan and finding the PA and returning to our station. Then the PAs decide to do the same search for the item we do going through the whole wall and asking the rebinners. Then they'll finally take the order to the problem solvers. By now well over 15 mins may have passed (and for our Dept thats TOT technically even though it's cause of their own decisions) and our rate has plummeted to a point you can't recover from. Let's just hope the next order isnt the same thing. And of course that means you'll probably get berated at stand-ups cause your rate is trash cause you spent 15mins looking for items that could have been missed out after a minute. 

To add insult to injury one of our PAs was fussing at an AA saying she needed to be packing when the AA clearly was trying to get more boxes cause our waterspiders. When this happens I was looking for an item and pressed the missing button to pull the full description of the item to search for it. I finally find the item and go to hit the back button to scan it in and finish my order and the PA decides to yell at someone across the wall which kinda startled me and I hit the continue button, missing the item out by accident. I tell them I had the order but they just stand there yelling about we miss out everything without looking and how I should have told them. I explained again the order was complete but hit continue by accident and they cut me off and keep going off. Like all you had to do was take it to PS and tell them it's complete or try to bring the order back. Instead you just stand there going off? Yeah that's definitely going to make me want to ""pack like there's no tomorrow"" irky as PA. 

Tldr: my AMs and PAs made a choice that slows down our rate and yell at AAs for the dumbest shit. Get better middle management AFC!",9,-1,t2_54op8adg,e48emi,Not found,t5_1387r9,1575167135,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/e48emi/ventrant_about_our_pas_and_ams/

submission,AmazonFC,1,"From L1 to L6! (**HELP**).CURRENT: 
Right now, I’m a L1, stowing. Next week is my 30 days, but I want to apply to L6, Operations Manager. 
* I’m leaning heavily on the Amazon’s Guideline in “Raising The Bar” and having “Super Powers” that would allow me to bring more to the job. 

BACKGROUND:
At the beginning of the year, I sold my company which came with a handsome payout BUT I was humbled real quick when I Entered a short position trading stocks and lost all of it. Which has lead me to the stow life! 

THE PROBLEM: 
After talking with several AM’s &amp; PA’s over the past 30 days, I’ve concluded TWO major inefficiencies: 
1. Communications between key roles (i.e. PA’s &amp; AM’s, etc.)
2. NO CLEAR access to information. (i.e. PA’s &amp; AM’s never knowing who’s trained in what, the many of tabs open to “keep track”, etc.)
Both of these give me massive anxiety! LOL

THE POSSIBILITY:
My background is in Software Development with a focus on Leadership. 
I want to develop a dashboard for PA’s &amp; AM’s improving efficiency, communication, cutting cost, saving frustrating hours and ultimately fostering morale. I’m only beginning to understand the problems as I am in the outside looking in. BUT with knowledge of both the problem and possibility, I have the track record for this production along with a foundational plan to ensure the vision is built. 

QUESTIONS: 
1. Is it possible to move up from an L1 to an L6? 
2. Is there a route you could recommend or any advice on how to go about obtaining this position? 
3. OR what are the right questions I should be asking at this point? 

*If you’re a GM, I’d love to speak with you on the phone and am even willing to compensate you for your time!

submission,AmazonFC,1,"How do you feel about being an AFM?Hello everyone!

I’ve been working at a brand new robotics fulfillment center for a little over two months now. I started in ICQA and the first day I laid eyes on those drive units... I knew I had to get closer to them. So I expressed interest in it and I was chosen to cross train as an Amnesty Floor Monitor. I’ve been doing this for about five weeks now and overall, I enjoy being an AFM, but I’m looking to do more. For some reason, Amazon treats us like children and won’t let us do many things that I consider to be an essential part of the job. For the most part, I understand why they have so many limitations. They want to reduce our time on the floor as much as possible and for numerous safety reasons. But there’s no reason why we can’t replace a torn up fiducial in front of a station that is causing drives to bomb out, for example. It would be quicker for us to replace it as soon as we discover it. Which means that associate would has less down time. I know my PA is pushing for us to do more, but I doubt there will be any changes any time soon.  

So to anyone who has been, or is currently an AFM.. What do you like about the job? What don’t you like about the job? Do you feel like we could be doing more? What are some changes you’d like to see? I’m curious to know how other people feel about it.",2,-1,t2_4e17dlb9,e6bc6m,Not found,t5_1387r9,1575517182,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/e6bc6m/how_do_you_feel_about_being_an_afm/

So, I've recently interviewed for Area Manager position at Amazon and received an offer letter yesterday. This is my first ever full-time job offer, so I am very curious about each any every aspect and excited but at the same time not sure if this is the right job for me.

Here goes my question 1 regarding this. I interviewed for Area Manager, but my offer letter says the position that I am being offered is Shift Manager. (Somewhere in the email they also mentioned that  ""Area Managers within AMZL are called either “Shift Managers” or “Area Manager, Delivery Ops.”). However, I am still curious about this. 

Can someone kindly elaborate further on this, please? Is there any difference between Area Manager vs Shift Manager? Is  being a Shift Manager easier or harder than being an AM?

She agreed and I watched her rearrange a few things at my station. I thought I might actually learn something new. 

Nope, I just got to watch my takt time plummet from 24.5 to 36 as she had problems stowing my inventory. She tried to shove the 9 inch items into the 6 bins, but could not. She couldn’t load the heavy 18s anywhere because the bottom of those bins were full. She was turning away pod after pod.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"We are proud of you, and I hope every amazon associate knows that.I’m gonna get cheesy. 

I’m an L3 shift assistant at a delivery station in the Midwest. A little over a year ago I started as an associate during the overnight sort shift at the launch of our site. 6 months later I accepted an offer as a Tier 3 On Road shift assistant. Then 2 weeks ago I accepted an offer as a Level 3 shift assistant to come back to operations and run MCO (Cycle 2). 

I’m not a manager, shift assistants simply run shifts while L4’s and above monitor and do other duties L3’s cannot. I am responsible for the success of the shift, placing the right people in the right place, keeping induction and stow rates at the right place, and coaching associates to get to where they’d like to be. 

So I don’t know how much this means, but I am just so proud of the associates I work with. I came in to help smooth out the way MCO was running, and bring my experience to help others grow. The changes I’ve put in place were met with optimism and it was so refreshing. 

I am in awe of the hard work, ambition and commitment our associates put forth every day. They are incredible and I could never thank them enough. I try to make it clear at every stand up that they are so important and so appreciated. And that we are absolutely in this together. The day MCO got the highest volume we have seen yet, everyone, our station manager, shift managers, hell even HR was on the floor working along side associates to get everything inducted and stowed. 

I am grateful that we are a team, that we work side by side, as one, to get the job done. We unload trucks together, we stow together, and most importantly we support each other and share laughs. 

I read a lot of posts where associates don’t have a great experience working with amazon and it just makes me sad. I wish every station was like the one I’m at. The pride we share in the work we do every day is so rewarding. 

So yes, someone is proud of you and grateful for the work you do. I hope you know that.",15,-1,t2_vgnwgl4,e76tz9,Not found,t5_1387r9,1575676985,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/e76tz9/we_are_proud_of_you_and_i_hope_every_amazon/

-I can no longer access the Schedule tab for internal transfers.

-I can no longer access the bug report link for the app

Are these issues due to my shift code change, or is it a technical issue?

So thanksgiving week I ended up getting sick getting out on antibiotics and getting a severe allergic reaction to the meds causing me to end up in the hospital, in the midst of this I called the erc/myleave to see what my best options where since I’ve only been here for a month and obviously don’t have the time to be out for my 4 day work week. The lady on the phone said no worries just do medical leave, fill out paperwork and you’ll be good. Fast forward I went back to work (I work sat-tues inbound stow night shift ) Saturday swiped my badge everything was fine still didn’t hear anything from my leave. From lunch till this moment I haven’t been able to punch in I’ve had to manually punch in from atoz, I’ve been calling my leave going back and forth to finally get someone to tell me that I’ve been denied because I’ve been out 6 days instead of 7 which is short term medical minimum. I said had I known that I would’ve stayed home for the 7 days. So I’ve been back and forth with HR and the erc trying to figure something out since I’m in the negative upt now. Mainly bc I can’t fix my punches but I’ve been at work and my manager knows my situation and knows I’m trying to fix it, but I got an e mail tonight saying possible job abandonment for negative upt from my punches missed. I go back in tomorrow idk what to do and I know everyone says that’s it your done they’ll fire you like that but really really don’t want that to happen, my HR said they messed up the paperwork somewhere for me so idk if that’s hope that she will help because the decision is on them now for the 4 days I was out . I don’t want to be paid just want to upt hours back that’s all. Please please any insight even if you want to pm me .

submission,AmazonFC,1,"Leave of absence questions.
Hey guys! So I just started working at amazon like a month ago after giving birth to my son 2 months before . I had high blood pressure through my pregnancy and it stuck around after . We all know the FC buildings can be super hot and we get sweaty . So last week at work I started feeling the symptoms of my high blood pressure getting worse to where I was getting overheated , dizzy and blurred /spotty vision . I went to the doctor the next day and was given a note for two days so I can rest I went back to work the 6th and paid a visit to my facilities HR because they deducted upt which made me go negative and they explained that the only possible way to get it fixed would be to apply for medical  leave which requires a minimum of seven days off .  The day I went back on 12/6 about 3 hours into my shift I started feeling the symptoms I was having two days before again . So at break I clocked out and drove back to the same doctor who confirmed my blood pressure was really high and as per my request wrote me off for 7 days 12/4-12/12 . The person handling my “my leave” case keeps stating that my release to work date is today 12/12 but I’ve always thought and been told that you return to work the day after the last day which is covered on your note .. so in my case that would be tomorrow (the 13th)correct? 


And aside from that has anyone had any issues with these myleave things? Like it’s so confusing ... they told me I need a release to work note as well as paper work stating if I have limitations while working like if I need any special accommodations. They told me I need those papers filled out before I can even return to work but also before before a certain date . Okay ? But if I’m not allowed to return to work without the accommodation paper even if I have a release to work note but I have until the end of the month to get the papers done . Does that mean if I have to go back to see my doctor to get it filled out that I’d have to take another day off in order to get it done and risk getting held accountable? Makes no sense.",1,-1,t2_40si1pes,e9tcd5,Not found,t5_1387r9,1576183514,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/e9tcd5/leave_of_absence_questions/

submission,AmazonFC,1,"My Advice For Getting A Nicer Job Within An Amazon FC.I have made few long winded comments on how to move up at an FC at Amazon from a Fulfillment Associate role (aka Dock/Receive, Stow, Pick, Count, Induct, Pack/Singles/SmartPac and Sort). These jobs all involve tracking your rate and are some of the most restricting and least pleasant jobs in the building. 

While some of you may be content with your Fulfillment Associate job and don’t mind the grind, I’m sure there is a fair number of you who are fed up  with your current role....but how do you go about it? Here is what I recommend: 


If you are just starting at Amazon, you are probably going to be fed up with your direct role about a 4 weeks to a month and a half from your first day of doing it. Do everything in your power to convince your manager to put you in an indirect role like Problem Solve or one of the Quality HUD jobs for your path. You not only get a break from the monotony of your direct path, but you get access to a useful tool...a laptop.

Use the laptop that you have as an indirect to find available amazon employees only jobs through “Job Finder” which is found under “Resources” of your Amazon A to Z.  Make sure you have applied for the maximum number of open job apps that you can at any given time (5-6 active job applications).

You can access Job Finder from any Amazon computer, but unless you want to stay later than your normal shift or eat into your break to look at jobs, you’ll definitely want to get an indirect role to get access to a laptop so you can apply for jobs while on shift.

Imo, the better jobs in the building are HR, Learning, IT, Safety, TOM Team and non-inventory. These jobs have little to no rate and you will have much more flexibility and freedom as a whole.

You’ll probably get denied from a fair number of jobs, but in this case, quantity&gt;quality.  As FC Associate is one of the more crudy jobs of a FC, almost every job you apply for is an improvement. The key is to NOT GET DISCOURAGED. The more active jobs you have open, the higher your chance of one of those jobs panning out...and you only need 1 to pan out...

Amazon is huge. Technical issues happen all the time, applications get lost and it is easy to be forgotten. This means YOU have to push and keep close attention to the status of your application. Talk to HR every day and ask for updates of the status of your application. Don’t be scared about annoying HR, MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN. 

Eventually one job will want to interview you. Once this happens, brush up on what STAR format interviewing is and tap every resource you can find to get preparation for the interview, especially this sub. 

Each job has a very particular set of things that the department interviewing you is looking for. These points are printed out onto a sheet of paper and are given to the person interviewing you, and then at the end of the interview THEY TELL YOU THOSE BULLET POINTS!!!! This means if you find someone who has interviewed for the same job you are about to interview for, then you can get those points from them and know exactly what to say in your interview.

Next thing you know, you are inclined for the job you applied for and the next opening for that job  that becomes available is yours.

Sauce: I was in Pick for 4 months, got into Pick Hud, then applied for a job as an Equipment Coordinator a few months later and as of now I’m a Support Tech. Let me tell you, I have my own personally assigned computer and my own desk where I can SIT and do tickets, listen to podcasts with the IT provided HEADPHONES and have ZERO rate....it beats the shit out of Pick!",41,-1,t2_c3tiw,e9x1t7,Not found,t5_1387r9,1576200857,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/e9x1t7/my_advice_for_getting_a_nicer_job_within_an/

submission,AmazonFC,1,Rant lul.Hi so its been a little bit over a month since I started im in Afe packing an I also gift wrap. My rates aren’t good emotes for em even though i try my best to be fast. An its very demoralizing that my best isnt good enough. My rates average 177. I don’t think I’ll ever get to /250 an hour like they want. I try so hard though. Im sad that I don’t get any scratch offs even though i try to be a good worker in peak. I fix their machines constantly for myself an for others. Its an easy fix. Easier if they let us have screw drivers to tighten screws.  Its frustrating trying to keep my rate up when i have no boxes an things are breaking. And then they come move me to another wall an to a station that’s completely wiped. I got talked to during the paid break because I didn’t sign in an start packing straight away because I decided to fill up my boxes so my managers think i was fooling around being late for 8 minutes. Yet i watch others just sit on the floor an constantly leave.  I get chronic migraines an now theyre starting to happen more often because of the strain. An its effecting my work rates. But im still working through the pain an trying not to cry.  I wanna level up my job but I don’t know how. I tried saying if you need help anywhere im willing to learn but they mention rates. In my fc all they care about is rebiners. Like ok how do i get to do that because alot of people who started with me are rebins now.,17,-1,t2_13b3up,eb97n9,Not found,t5_1387r9,1576465550,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/eb97n9/rant_lul/
submission,AmazonFC,1,"Just started two days ago. Advice for a new FC worker?Hey guys so I just started working at a FC part time for a ten hour shift Saturday and Sunday. Im a tier one blue badge, if thats the right way to put it. This weekend was my first weekend and it was great, the complete opposite of the horror stories on the news and online. Team has been friendly, lots of laughs and everyone is positive. Do you guys have any advice for a newcomer? 

Im working in receiving, doing rainbow and each receive. Rainbow seems easier even though it's more lifting, due to the lower quota. Each receive is triple rainbow, so thats more demanding but seems manageable. Any tips to me more efficient in either of those places? Also I try to stretch a lot during the day, doing squats and what not to stay loose. Any other tips not to get sore by the end of the day? Only thing I haven't been able to figure out yet is how to stay well hydrated. I usually drink at least half a gallon but normally a gallon of water a day. I just forget when im working at amazon. 

Also anything that looks good for management that I can do? I naturally try to keep busy at all times because I can't stand being bored, but anything to stand out or make a good impression that I can do? Everyone has reiterated multiple times that we won't be held to metrics for weeks and expectations aren't terribly high and we will be fine as long as we aren't in the bottom 5%, but I want to do well anyway. So any advice overall would be appreciated.

I've been missing a bunch of the shifts because I cant afford to get to work 2x a day with the very very poor pay amazon provides for us perm part timers and it's been messing me up. 

The hr advised I cant drop my VET once signed up for it but I never signed up for 6 days a week of doubles for this week and next week excluding xmas. So what gives? I think they did it on purpose to get rid of employees who obviously cant make it.

Leads into my next issue so with that being said 


I've had to overdraw my bank to be able to afford the gas for work each week and its putting me in more and more debt to the point that my bank closed my account because I'm not able to bring it positive again. 

So I switched my direct deposit over last week before friday and said could take a single pay period after the change to apply and it's been 2 checks now into the wrong account leaving me with no money. 

What can I do to fix this? If my next check goes into the wrong account again for the 3rd time I'll have to resign and just be unemployed thanks to amazon f***ing my life up all over.

The manager there (I don’t know her title but she’s above all the stow AM’s) got really upset. She said we were “just irresponsibly standing around” and that “you’re all getting TOT.” One of us asked if we could get assigned stow stations, and she said “no. Just stand there.”  So we did, for 20-25 minutes.  She was just rude and treated us like garbage. Couldn’t even say something like “I understand you were confused.

I've worked in TQM, Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma environments.  I'm fit and as capable of the physical side of the job as most of my 20-30 YO counterparts.

Turns out it was 57% which is basically an F. Yikes. Anyway, she politely told me that I should try to get up to at least 80% and that I should be picking 3 items per minute.

This is the first time I knew or even thought about my pick rate. I never thought I was too slow and it’s not like I’m dragging my feet or anything. It didn’t SEEM like I was going any slower or faster than anyone else. I just push my cart and move my legs fast enough to not ram into anything. Now I’m wondering if I’m supposed to be speed-walking to the point where my body aches.

Can my pick rate go up within a shift? Does it take a couple shifts? Any tips on how to maintain a good rate? (unless “go faster” really is just it)

Also, should I be seriously concerned that I could be let go?

submission,AmazonFC,1,"[Serious question] Is it possible that gangs exist within Amazon FCs?I know this sounds crazy, but hear me out...

At our FC, there's a group of tier 1s in the Mods who simply don't do much if any work.  They gather in and around several queue / aisle intersections with their U-boats and cut up for hours on end.  The guys in the group get their gangsta talk going loudly complaining about the FC and the managers.  They try to impress the women who gather with them by talking about having sex with them, relaying stories about dealings with cops and reminiscing about how wasted they got last weekend.  The women just fawn all over them.  Nobody even tries to be discreet about it.  You can hear them carrying on from six aisles away.  Sometimes it goes on for hours at a time, and happens almost every day.  It's really disturbing to the work environment.

The reason I ask if there may be gangs is that NOBODY pays any attention to them.  Nobody asks them to get back on task.  They are all blue badges, and they NEVER get fired or corrected from what I can see.  It's as if the managers are intimidated by this group of people.

Other people in the Mods get written up and/or fired with regularity for much less severe performance issues.

I had an experience a long time ago with a factory in Northern Spain where there was a small Basque contingent ""working"" in the factory.  They didn't really work at all.  They showed up when they wanted to and collected paychecks.   I later found out that there was a secret deal between this group and management where they would be left alone to do as they pleased in exchange for not causing trouble in the factory.

Just wondering if this kind of thing could happen in a Amazon FC.",6,-1,t2_5db8uwq0,el5js4,Not found,t5_1387r9,1578367756,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/el5js4/serious_question_is_it_possible_that_gangs_exist/

I have a question about what options I have and what I can do to get there with my degree. I was told I can try for AM, PA, or IT. Many say coming from an engineering background means getting AM is a longshot. Some say PA is easier to obtained and can lead into AM. I have helped run a business before (became temporary owner for a few months), and the business never failed and did quite well. Does this mean I have a decent chance at AM or should I pursue PA?. IT is cool, but the openings are limited at the moment til people transfer. 

I'm just hoping to move up into new things this year because stow is getting very boring. I'm so far trained in water spider, stow, FUD (pick / stow), inbound dock, outbound dock, count, and 5S.

I was really hoping we would return to the previous schedule before peak of 7:30am-12:00pm but I'm beginning to worry this isn't the case. I could manage with the shorter schedule much better. Unfortunately the other day during stand up, we were told that 300 rate will be the new average as they bump up the workload in C2 (I used to do night shift and hated it, so I transferred to mornings because it was suppose to be easier) so I'm honestly a bit apprehensive at the thought. Add into the fact that we may be starting earlier? 5:46am-1:15pm instead and both just don't really sit well with me so I'm curious to know if anyone has got any info about upcoming schedule changes? Preferably at the sorting facility. 

I learned that all sort facilities have the same schedules so I wanted to find out if anyone else heard anything? Because if it's true, I may want to look into transferring to another shift like the Flex shift.

submission,AmazonFC,1,"Question about conversion: am I being hired on or not?I'm a white badge working as a picker at a brand new FC (soft opened in August) and I was hired on Halloween day for Peak 2019. Things have been going okay, there's almost no one left from my training and orientation so I've basically gotten through the worst of it, and I've only gotten a couple coachings but in a nice way, all the PA's and managers are really cool, I have 0 points, I've been there on time every shift, and my rate is okay as a picker (but could always be better, I'm constantly trying to improve) I need to work on quality more than rate but that's not really the issue.  


So I applied for conversion to a blue badge on December 20th as early as it was available because I knew Peak would be ending soon and I wanted to be kept on for as long as possible, after filling out the application I got the email for the contingent offer on the basis of background check/drug screening, yada yada yada, filled out MyDocs to agree to it, and then was told to wait for the follow up email to finalize conversion.  


But that was more than a month ago and here I am, after Peak, still a white badge, just waiting to either be converted to blue or get the axe. So my question is this: is HR just taking their time, because as far as I know, none of the white badges have been converted to blue so far, or is the contingent offer email just a bad joke and I'm still liable to be let go at any moment and at my next shift not able to badge in at the turnstile?

Also, I was told a while back from people that the only requirement is that you have to have at least 15 hours of UPT but even current ambassadors I've asked were a little confused as to what the exact requirements were. Also, a lot of our current ambassadors at my FC have write-ups for rate or quality, which is a really sad situation considering they're the ones training new hires. 

While somewhat new to Amazon (8 months, 7 as blue badge), my rates in all AFE roles have been very high. I've stepped up my rebin game, now averaging 700+ UPH (I averaged over 1000 twice!), 1350 induct and 330 pack. I've never had any quality problem (usually top 3 in the department and almost always better than team goal for dpmo) and my rates are very solid, 0 write-ups, with 27hours UPT.

comment,AmazonFC,2,"My Reddit account is 6 years old.

I'm 26.

I live in Florida, USA. Eastern Standard Time.

I'm most active on Reddit when I'm not at work. At the least, 4 days a week between 1800 to 0000 and on my days off anytime between 0800 to 0000. Sometimes I browse reddit while at work, but not always.

I want to be a moderator for this subreddit as I care for my fellow Amazonians and want to contribute to shaping communities designed for them.

I find my communication skills to be acceptable but can always use improvement. Between GEMBA meetings, my time as a PA/PG, and previous work history, I know how to speak properly. From previous moderator experience, various role-playing games, and the few courses I took between high school and college, I believe I can write just as proper.

I have slight experience with CSS, due to time spent working with PHP, Python/Django, and various other projects. While I don't have the expert css knowledge seared into my head, I do have the technical experience to learn it easily. I have no experience with automoderator but I do have experience in photoshop due to previous work at a camera store. I'm not an artist by any means however.

I've been an outbound dock associate in an FC since the start of September 2018, as both a donut shift and front half nights. I've learned every position from robotics operator to pit driver. I outperformed our seasonal PA's and was the only person on the dock to pass the interviews for the permanent PA positions, but stepped down after a couple weeks due to personal and work related issues. I'm currently trying to transfer to other departments to gain further FC experience as I believe there is nothing left for me to learn on the dock.

I would strive to improve upon the lack of sponsored open conversation threads. In most Amazon worker groups/reddits, users have to sift through dozens of random threads or questions in order to find the real conversations that impact them. Having daily types of pinned threads that don't just replace but add on to previous similar threads would act as sort of a hub of information while still promoting more discussion. In theory this kind of idea is used on all sorts of subreddits but in practice is never used properly, leading to weekly threads in which users ask the same questions as the previous week just to receive the same copy/pasted answer.",0,t3_c2bgis,t2_93slg,ertubi2,t3_c2bgis,t5_1387r9,1561253517,URL not found

Rates are communicated to manager from senior management. I believe they inflate the numbers themselves to ensure the building is making profit off the operation. Your manager may or may not inflate that number they receive depending on their management style.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"• My Reddit account is 4 years old. 

• I am 21 years old! 

• I live in Florida, USA, EST 

• I’m most active typically during late morning through late afternoon or night, and early morning after my shifts. Working nights gives me a flexible schedule!

• By nature, I love to help people learn and I love to spread good information. 

• As I’m sure most AA’s are aware, communication has become a vital part to working at Amazon overall, and I agree with that. Lack of communication is at LEAST 9/10 the reason why mistakes happen. Its a valuable life skill.

• I do not have experience with CSS/auto-moderator, I do have some experience editing images, though. 

• I have been an AA for just over 2 years, and I work at a SC rather than an FC, which could provide a unique benefit, as we have slightly different building procedures. I am and have been a Learning Ambassador for just over a year, and I am trained in every process in a SC EXCEPT PIT. ( We do not utilize it much anymore. ) However, all other critical roles, I have. (Waterspider, Problem Solve, TDR, Flow Control, all In/Outbound processes, etc) and I am on the Associate Safety Committee; which just got revamped in my building and we actually get to do hands on work with safety. This is my career choice in about the next year so I’m happy to help!

comment,AmazonFC,10,"Actual AC in the buildings or some kind of better ventilation at our stations. I know the temp is determined by location but I think there could be a way to make it better for all.

For example, at arsaw pick stations, perhaps install stroller fans that are battery powered for the pickers to have some kind of air? I know it probably sounds crazy but I’ve picked a few that are different sizes and I’m sure it could work somehow.

comment,AmazonFC,2,"At my delivery station, the three days I worked we did pretty horribly. We had a target of 65-70k but i don't think we got close to hitting it because 1) it's hot as hell this week and it's affecting everyone 2) most of the AAs that don't normally work night shift but took VET don't know how to do anything 3) we're getting a shitload of returns because drivers can't deliver the packages for some reason?

The worst thing to happen was the Thu-Fri overnight, my last shift of the week, somebody screwed up running the container planning thing (that groups the packages into sort zones) and it put packages into the 60 or so aisles along our longest belt that we haven't used since last peak season, and which don't have carts, bags, or most of their floor stickers set up. And apparently there is no possible way to run the container plan again so we had to spend 2+ hours setting those aisles up, using every cart and every bag in the building (even getting unopened boxes of bags from somewhere offsite) and we still didn't have enough bags. So we only ended up moving about 30k packages. I could have come in Friday night but after that fiasco I was done with Prime Week. Oh yeah did I mention problem solve also ran out of tape? Because no one thought to take stock of our important inventory before Prime Week? Completely incompetent.",0,t3_cg9x64,t2_1c6grsip,eufmc7w,t3_cg9x64,t5_1387r9,1563780613,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,sounds horrible. all i had to worry about was stowing. but it was endless boxes. and people only doing the small envelopes and leaving me the big boxes. i complained to the ambassadors but they are so busy they don’t care... dropped my rate from 300 to 245. either than that got free food and some cool swag. not bad for my first big event. i’m just curious how long they will keep us. i’m a white badge and they tell us we have no job security and i really like it at amazon. wonder when they will start letting people go. one ambassador said volume usually drops down after these events. so who knows,0,t1_eufmc7w,t2_n5g5m,eufnwfz,t3_cg9x64,t5_1387r9,1563782744,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,2,"I would like to see a change in the promotion process. Currently it seems to intentionally only go by the interview and completely ignore your skills, experience, and work you put forward. For example I use to run shifts (PG) but then when I would go interview they would literally not care and not talk to my boss about how I did running shift and instead only care how I answered the behavioral questions. In an effort to take bias out of promotions they seemed to have completely taken any incentive out for people to actually learn things or put forward the extra work. 

I finally got promoted a few months ago but wow have I seen some really smart hard working perfect candidates get ignored because they don't go good at saying what some HR person wants to hear for ""name a time you deat with _____""",0,t3_cftcps,t2_q7gf41d,eugc890,t3_cftcps,t5_1387r9,1563804910,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. ToT is measured by your last scan, and after a certain period (I believe varies depending on what exactly you're doing). For most rated work that i'm personally aware of, its after 5 minutes of not scanning anything.
2. Branching off that, after 30 minutes of Total ToT for the day, someone very well may come and coach you on why exactly you were not busy working during that period and if you have barriers etc. After 1 hour its a final written warning, and 2 hours you can be let go. I'm a bit fuzzy on those details though, so I may have it mixed up on that. But over an hour and you're in bad shape for ToT.
3. ToT is kind of factored into your rate, there's direct time in path that focus on the rate you're scanning items and how many you're doing for that hour. 
4. Going to the bathroom will impact your rate, yes, generally they're lenient about this to a certain extent. I wouldn't miss your fast starts though, they'll likely tell you to try and use the bathroom on your own time. But i've personally never had any issues with going to the bathroom other than that. Most reasonable people will excuse it, if its not impacting things heavily.
5. Learning ambassadors aren't always the best at every single detail, they are generally the only ones who volunteer to do it though. Things aren't always perfectly organized and handled well but for the most part people get trained to do the basics of whatever path they are in and are expected to learn as they go. And yeah, a lot of the time there can be a slight disconnect in leadership of certain departments. If there are a lot of people, its harder for some to connect with those that work under them - and you're just a number.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I'm not sure if its something that is network wide or not, but fast starts at my building are the first 15 minutes after stand-up and breaks/lunch. Depends on what path you're working on, scan a certain amount of items in this time period/pack this many orders etc.   
As long as you're doing rated work, your ToT will certainly kick in. If you aren't getting any work, if you readily have access to a shift supervisor/PA or a manager it will help to check with them or let them know you have nothing. They should track your time to prevent ToT, but it depends honestly.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. Sounds like you're working in Flow, I only have about an hours worth of experience in packing in flow but - when you don't have the right items you can generally just mark what you don't have as missing and set those items to the side. I believe there is a dedicated bin to place your overages/damages in, but I can't be certain on that. 
2. I can partially answer this, i'm not familiar with how that's measured but if you upgrade boxes without selecting it in the system/ the box getting kicked out *may* be attributed to you, but that's uncertain. If an order to pack comes to you incomplete however, that isn't on you. Only if you pack an order that's not complete, and send it off in cases of shotgunning items and over scanning. 
3. Mostly you wont have to interact as much with problem solvers, not sure how they operate in Flow, but I believe they are notified when items are marked as missing/overages/damages/etc. and is added to a queue and their overall numbers. There's usually a dedicated area for them.
4. Set the items to the side, or like I mentioned earlier there should possibly be a dedicated bin for setting broken orders in for collection. Your best bet would be to inquire with someone who's been there longer.
5. Rate's are determined by the top 70% of performers I believe, and are constantly changing due to that fact. The best resource of finding that out, would be your manager/PA
6. They'll come talk to you face to face about it
7. Temp agency? I'm not too familiar with how they operate, but when I was a white badge, you had to speak with one of their managers/coaches.",0,t3_cj6e9x,t2_q0kp1,evbjlad,t3_cj6e9x,t5_1387r9,1564379990,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. I’m not sure what Flow is, but I’ve heard AFE mentioned. Are those two the same? A dedicated bin for missing items would be useful, I’ll ask about that my next shift.

2. During my last shift a box was too small to fit the items, so I chose a bigger one and shipped it. From what you said, that might show as a quality hit for me? How do I select a different box in the system? What do you mean by shotgunning items and over scanning?

5. I’ll ask about rates my next shift. I thought they were set by Amazon. Interesting to know they change over time.

7. I’m a blue badge hired by Amazon, so I don’t think temp agency rules would apply. I just heard someone mention attendance points and thought they were universal.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. AFE is Flow, yes. Upgrading/downgrading a box is fine - to an extent as long as you're not downgrading a box to a jiffy/envelope and that you're selecting the option 'Wrong Box Size' on your screen if its implemented at your site.   

2. Shotgunning items would be like, if you have a bunch of items that all *appear* the same. They may not be, so you don't want to sit there scanning just one asin. Scan each one to avoid issues, but it sounds like you don't do that. 
3. As for tracking your time, there should be a tab on the hub for seeing how much PTO/Vacation/UPT you currently have,and any recorded absences that may have deducted UPT from your account. Although it varies depending on where you work I believe. Some people see sick time and such.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"To add on to what coolm3 said, being clocked in affects your rate unless you’re labor tracked.  If you didn’t know, being labor tracked means your time is accounted for and you won’t roll up with ToT.  Stand-ups and on-the-clock breaks go into your rate.  So a tip would be, if someone tells you the rate they’re looking for, it’s a good idea to shoot for a little above so it will even out by the end of the day.  Also, after your 1 month mark, you’ll be expected to hit rate, but I don’t believe you can get written up unless you’re under 75% of the expected rate.  If you’re 75-100% they might talk to you, ask about your barriers and give you tips.  Good luck!",0,t3_cj6n95,t2_rekm4,evbyi9l,t3_cj6n95,t5_1387r9,1564400263,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I've not worked in this particular warehouse, but from my particular experience I can say that:

1. Depending on the type of building you work at, things may vary on how you encounter this. I've no experience in working in an AR building, so I can't comment.
2. Pickers select the items that are placed in the bins on numbers shelves for storage (pods for AR), stowers are the ones who store those very same items into those pods. Receive gets the items from the trucks on the dock - i'm not familiar with that area so I cannot speak on the various jobs that may be there. Beyond pick, there are things like Pack - Flow (AFE) which is the primary outbound area of most buildings. Some others have secondary departments, that handle excess work that AFE cannot handle. Though i've seen at least one other building run two AFE departments. Support for each departments are, PA's which are shift supervisors, AM's which are Area Managers and above that Operations Managers. Under PA's would be your waterspiders, tote runners, whatever roles they've got set up at the building. 
3. Your 15 minute breaks are essentially set in stone for the most part, they have a system that excuses your rate and ToT for the duration of the set breaks at my building at least. There are few exceptions where you can take a break at a later time rather than at the established one - and those are generally only for Indirect roles where work may cause you to be late if you wish to be efficient after break ends. You can use your breaks to go to the bathroom though, yes. They'll tell you your break is 10 minutes with 5 minute travel time.   
I wouldn't be afraid to head to the bathroom though, if you need to go, go. The only issue i've had come up about them so far has been when it interfered with fast start.
4. I cannot answer this one properly as I don't know how demanding it is to work at an AR facility, possibly getting comfortable shoes? Be prepared to walk a lot? Not sure, as for pickers they don't seem to have to worry about that with shelves being brought to them.
5. Overtime can be for any shift if its assigned, depends on the business need of your specific building and if they need to get orders shipped out on time. Not sure how it works with how they have it set up, looks like its 3 days a week and doesn't specify a determined overtime date. Maybe during peak it will be established, something to ask your recruiter perhaps or manager if you get hired.",0,t3_cjf06o,t2_q0kp1,evd90y2,t3_cjf06o,t5_1387r9,1564432796,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"formal flow am here (many years ago i will do ma best), 

week one? your ambassador should have coached about your questions

&amp;#x200B;

kinda want to see your shift's hourly ob missing reports 

many variations :/ an inexperienced or rebinner with poor qualities can cause pack associate's barriers 

please check if chute etiquette is great (left to right or right to left &amp; within your reach) 

chute etiquette impacts your takt time/pack rate/even your safety (address to your ams) 

overage can be from switcheroo too especially quantity items - as pack associate 

(if you shift have a decent sort pg/pa can mitigate overage/missing asap +

they have to communicate well with problem solves instead of overage everything)

press an andon/psolve button to (psolver, pack pa or ams) communicate about a missing item or items or

communicate with rebinners too (their error, damaged and etc)

if you can pack around 300ish, just look for it adjacent chute or amnesty bin/psolve tote

&amp;#x200B;

network, afe 300 pack rate is very safe

sos, during breaks (after rollover) &amp; eos talk to your pack pa, and ams about your learning curves + rates

please ask them too! for shift standards they will have better answers for you",0,t3_cj6e9x,t2_3p6unjur,evdtq67,t3_cj6e9x,t5_1387r9,1564447239,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1," You will have no say in what dept you are placed.  You will be placed in whatever department has a need.  If you have no write-ups, you can apply for a transfer to a different department after 30 days.

If you choose the 5:15pm start time you will be in inbound, which includes inbound dock and stow.  Stow is very   physically demanding.

If you choose the 6:15 start time you could be anywhere in AFE (packing or any of the related pack jobs) or in picking or counting. For me, these are less physically demanding than stowing.  All jobs will have you going home tired.  Stow will have you going home tired and sore.

For any department, to prepare yourself, walk or stand in place for 12.5 hours allowing yourself two 15 minutes breaks and one 45 minute break.

You can go to the bathroom anytime you want and if you go once during each of your 4 quarters it won't affect your rate if you're a motivated worker who gives a fair amount of effort.  Bathrooms are no more than a 2 minute walk from anywhere in the building.

So let’s say the goal pack rate is 100 and you start counting how many you do and count 100.  When they come around and tell you your rate or if you ask for it they’ll say it’s around 90 because the time starts when you clock in not when you start packing.  Don’t skip stand-up or breaks, they allot time for you to sit because you need it.  Drink plenty of water and take breaks and eat right and that should be enough for you to hit rate.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Your information wasn't correct though. Rate is generated from how long you've been in that path, if you're not signed into that path, you're not generating rate for it. You generate time off task. When you keep yourself signed into a path, you're generating minutes of idle time. Yes, i'm aware of being capable of going back and fixing time as i've had to go about doing so myself. 

Lets say, for example you're working two different paths at a time. You get some totes scanned, then you flex to another path to do work there if the work is low. If you sign out of the scanner, or station, whatever- your rate in that path you signed out of will not get lower as it would if you happened to leave yourself signed in. The best thing to do if you're not going to be working at a station etc for an extended period of time is to sign out of that path.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I just started two weeks ago, as inbound stow person. I can’t tell you a whole bunch but this is my general impression from the short time that I’ve been there. 

On stow, you have 7 minutes in between scans. If it takes you longer than that, you’re risking a write up. Make your bathroom breaks shorter than that. It can be a hard thing to do because bathrooms can take a little walking to get to. Double time it. 

Generally, you will want to have a stow rate of 250 an hour. If all you’re getting is small items, then this will be 400 items an hour. It’s doable and you’ll get a mix of big and small items. Just be fast and remember where you stowed things, as you can’t stow the same items next to each other, only diagonally (checkerboard pattern). You’ll have a weird purple light thing that will light up the cubbyholes that you can’t stow things in but it’s not perfect and you’ll have to occasionally just remember where you put things. Don’t overpack the holes and don’t let things hang out because they can fall out and create troubles. 

It’s gonna be physical work so be prepared for that. You’ll be constantly moving and will be sore for the first couple of weeks. Take care of your body and stay hydrated. Bring a clear water bottle. Eat good and don’t stuff yourself. 

I like the job so far and it’s not the horror stories that populate the interwebs, like some would suggest. It’s Amazon and Amazon is in the business of shipping stuff to a whole heap of people. This means that they’ve got quotas and deadlines to fulfill and it’s up to you to make sure they get fulfilled by doing your job. As long as you have a good work ethic, you’ll be fine. Work hard and safe. Pay is good and there are a lot of benefits to be had. 

I’d recommend it.",0,t3_cjf06o,t2_g624g,evv5wux,t3_cjf06o,t5_1387r9,1564821108,URL not found

Like I said before, you will be very sore for the first few weeks but as long as you get some rest and take care of yourself, you should be fine. That is just the nature of the job. Other than that, it is really easy and I don't get how some people are having trouble meeting quotas.

Then the day (today) and then the hours you want it to cover. For example you left at 12:30, you put in Aug 3rd, 12:30 to 4pm. Hit submit.

Then go back to request time off and do unplanned.
Again, partial day and put today's date, the hours, let's say 4pm to 6pm and then submit.

You have to do partial days and make sure your using PTO by the minute.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You actually don’t have to put in the UPT do you? Iv never done this. UPT is deducted automatically if you do not put in any time. 

So say I’m leaving at 2 and need to cover until 6 using 2 (PTO) and 2 (UPT) hours. I would put in the PTO from 2-4 or 4-6. And they UPT would be filled in automatically because the last 2 hours were unaccounted for. 

Iv always done this and never had any issues. I did however come across a glitch that happens sometimes when using all three types: UPT/PTO/Vacation in one day. It will take an hour of UPT sometimes if the time is not put in soon enough, and will not give it back like normally.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Ideally, I don't think you would want to bring specifically going into Amazon just so you can get a software job.

You'd want to say that you feel the company offers its employees a lot of internal growth or something similar.

The pay depends on the area. Here in FL a shift assistant is $18.50. I don't have any references on your specific job functions, though. Sorry.

Unlike the other comment, yes you can do a software related job after a while of working there. They also offer a lot of resources if you'd like to go into machine learning. They have a specific campus that sends associates to Seattle and they are placed in development roles. However, you have to be with the company for a year I believe for that.

Anyways, warehouses also have in-house jobs. Mine has ICQA web development and I think data analysts? You can apply pretty much to both whenever. The latter requires a degree, the former just a high school diploma and Java/Python/HTML knowledge.

Having income is always better than no income, so I'd say take the job and apply to other software positions while also keeping an eye out on jobfinder. Also, Amazon has many remote software engineer positions if that's a possibility.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. Write-ups: they are so many different reasons. Eventually you can get written up for rate, quality, etc. but you're brand new and there is a 5 week learning curve. Your PA/AM/ambassador will work with you. Write ups are a last resort. You can also get written up for behavioral things like causing fights, being an asshole or safety violations.

There are different levels for write ups. First one last 30 days, 60 days, etc. Depending on how severe the offense they can give you a final written but that's usually reserved for major safety violations and the like.

2. Packing is honestly one of the easier departments. Singles is easier than multis. Picking varies by building. I'm in an AR FC so we have vroomba like robots that bring old shelves to you. Still involves going up and down a step ladder, squatting, bending, standing. Some buildings are just miles of shelves and you will walk 20+ miles walking the shelves to pick items. 

3. They usually don't rebackground check, but for some promotions and positions they will drug test again or regularly.

4. Not sure about write-ups but don't think so. Rate, no. But depending on your building/Dept there should be a computer you can scan in to check, or ask your manager for your rate. They should be regularly telling you your rate though.

5. Your time is your time. Vacation needs 24+ hours approval. UPT and PTO they ask for an hour's notice. We had a new hire leave early using UPT her first 2 days. It's her time, we can't tell her no and she won't get in trouble.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Why are you looking for a career change? Amazon is a great opportunity, but it is a very unique place to work in. It is very high pressure. Think about the pressure you receive to perform well in HD and Costco and double it. I worked for a Walmart warehouse prior to Amazon and I thought the pressure was a lot there but Amazon is very high pressure. Think having your manager asking you several times a day why your team isn’t performing higher. There are many meetings throughout the day that discuss current performance and if you are not meeting goals you have to answer why in front of others. You are constantly put on the spot. Few people thrive in an environment like this and that is why the turnover rate for managers is so high. I would say that there is salary abuse there as you are required to work long hours but are not compensated more for it. 

That all being said, it is still a great opportunity. Amazon looks great on a resume and you will gain invaluable experience there. 4 day work week (most of the time) is great too. During Xmas, you will work 6 days a week which is very tiring. The advancement opportunity is great there but still very competitive.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Good AMs are always engaging their employees and always on top of their meetings/metrics. Time management skills are definitely needed. Most of the day revolves around talking to your employees, monitoring your operation, calling out anything that seems wrong, attending daily production meetings, and wrapping up and the end of the day meeting. As long as you can do that day after day, that will make a good AM.

Bad AMs don't have the drive or motivation to work the long shifts and ignore their employees. 

Relocation was offered for me if I lived a certain amount of distance from the building. I think it was 60 miles. They offered 3 different relocation packages. One was to handle the selling of your house and finding a new one. THe other was buying out your apartment lease and assisting in finding a new one. And the third was a pretax $10,000 lump sum.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"By learning curve 6, you're expected to be able to keep up with the pack rate. Learning curve 1 is expected to hit about 60, learning curve 2 at about a 70-75, etc.

The warning will come because you're regularly packing at under 100% to goal. This comes in to effect when you've packed for at least 5 hours on the same line. Your rate is the same as our Singles Large line. So packers are expected to aim for 93 units packed each hours, but a daily average of 83 units. Having a higher pure hour rate than daily average rate takes into account the paid break(s), station issues, bathroom breaks, lack of work etc.

You're getting a warning because you're regularly packing below the daily average goal of 83 units an hour. If the trend continues it eventually leads to write ups. You can try asking your PA or ambassador if someone can retrain or work with you to increase your rate. I work as a PA in singles and run an Excel sheet timer where we watch you pack 10 orders and time each step to see where there may be barriers or any way I can suggest to help speed up the process.",0,t3_cnjgne,t2_11jv66,ewbhnh1,t3_cnjgne,t5_1387r9,1565266617,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"to generally improve your accuracy:

**1. use an armband for the phone device:** you always want to be aware of whether or not the package you just stowed was done so properly. there is of course a learning curve on what the device does in reaction to anything you do or any mistake you make as a stower- that becomes second nature in time, but at the beginning it's best to keep that thing as close to you as possible because it has some counter-intuitive quirks (that really should be fixed on Amazon's part) that may trick into thinking you're doing the right thing but really none of your last 5,10, or heck even 50 stows actually counted for anything in the system. if your station doesn't have armbands as standard equipment for stowers, you can pick something up for cheap at the dollar store or off of ebay. even for $10 this thing would be well worth the money because it makes a bionic-level improvement in your accuracy as you can check on the scan status right away.. if you're the first one to do this at your station, you'll catch an ambassador's eye pretty quickly and they will probably become standard issue within a week or two.

to make packing your bags easier on yourself:

**2. pay attention to box sizes:** if your station has those 2.5ft wide by 2ft deep bags that come in green, black, teal, and yellow and go 6 to a rack then there are a few box sizes to pay special attention to because they either fit into the bags in one very specific way or there is a very convenient way to place them in order to allow for the greatest amount of flexibility with the remaining space for the rest of the night. Sizes to pay special attention to and get to know are: B02, K3/B42, B72, B73, B79, 1B4/B4D/BFD. for example, you can very exactly fit two K3/B42 boxes side by side at the deep end of the bag.

to speed up your rate once you've got the basics down:

**3. always take a minimum of two packages off of the rack:** (not applying to oversize-- don't overextend yourself!) this way, no matter which order you stow them in, you'll walk only have to walk as far as the bag for the most distant one and scan the one that's closer on the way there or on the way back!",0,t1_ewcg8ie,t2_2k7n57sv,ewcj9vo,t3_cnjwuu,t5_1387r9,1565285797,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Ok, thanks for the detailed response! I definitely want to increase my rate just to look good, but TBH my fear here at the moment is getting fired. I've heard that with warnings this can happen suddenly and automatically, so no one would be able to stop it. That's why I'm asking for specifics, like what is the next step that would cause me to be fired? It sounds like the write ups are actually the next step, which sounds better than fired, but I'd like to avoid that. Does that mean that literally every hour I need to be above the 83 rate for the next month to avoid a write up? Or is there any wiggle room with write ups? And, how bad is a write up? Am I basically fired at that point?

It also sounds like either way, though, I need to make that rate *every* hour to avoid future warnings (as long as there are no unavoidable problems like low volume)?",0,t1_ewbhnh1,t2_if4b3,ewcjgzq,t3_cnjgne,t5_1387r9,1565285892,URL not found

You think you can go faster than xxx today?”. This is because their minds are so small that little things like that can encourage the worker to work fast for their whole shift and they feel a sense of pride from it since they are tiny brain special need humans most often than not, being used by a multi billion corporation, just keep going slow and slow until they fire you or you quit and get a better job.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You won't walk in and just be suddenly fired because of one warning. There has to be a documentation trail, starting with verbal warnings.

Write-ups are the next steps, but it takes 3 before they will fire you. Amazon doesn't want to fire people. It's easier and cheaper to work with someone who is struggling than to go out and hire someone brand new that has to have a background and drug test and to train from scratch again.

You don't need to make rate every single hour but you do need to kick it up. There is a rule that if you're struggling but do 20% better, no matter what your rate is to start, you'll be fine. You should be aiming for 93 every hour, not 83. That way say your first hour there's no work you might pack a 65 by the second hour it picks up and you pack a 100, you'll be fine and average out.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Well TBH I don't have much experience in other lines but would be interested in trying. Right now my rate is pretty up and down. If I focus I can definitely maintain at least an 80 and if I push myself a little I can close between 90 to 100. So I think it's doable, but TBH I think it's a motivation thing. I like the idea of working hard, but I don't see myself staying at Amazon for many more years and frankly am ok with just 'getting by' for now.

They said I averaged a 67 one day and that's what triggered the warning. So, are you saying the daily average is the main thing? Not as much how I do in a single hour? Either way, it's great to know I'm not on the precipice of being fired and don't need to instantly jump to super-packer level. I can definitely pick an average above 83. 93 sounds doable, especially if technically it allows me to fall short a tad if it's just like for one hour or so.",0,t1_ewdl7ip,t2_if4b3,ewdsft3,t3_cnjgne,t5_1387r9,1565306659,URL not found

your first day will probably be a lil tour around the facility and then being trained w your group by a learning ambassador! it’ll be super chill(: delivery stations are super tiny compared to FC’s! 

you’ll likely be stowing, aka taking packages from shelves and scanning them into bags! it’s very easy, just a lot of walking/fast-paced, so stay hydrated!

and focus on quality over pace your first few weeks, as pace will naturally progress as u discover lil tips &amp; tricks to make it easier :D (and definitely get an arm band for your scanner, they should offer one to u but i didn’t have one for like my first week lol, it makes the process soooo much easier!!)

comment,AmazonFC,1,Flex been around for years since I started back in 2014. Flex it's just a new term it's also known as Alpha. For my facility alphaflex you have to pick up vet for at least seven times a month in order to stay active. One thing that is good about alphaflex is you're excluded from being laid off compared to White badges. However you cannot convert to a blue badge you have to quit and reapply and become a regular and not alphaflex. I was Alpha for 3 months and then quit and then reapplied again I became a regular did work my way up into shift assistant. As for alphaflex and you want to transfer at my facility you cannot transfer if alphaflex you're just stuck there again if you want to transfer you have to quit and reapply. Ask for being Alpha Flex you do get the benefits and everything else. I hope that answer your question. And one thing that I like about alphaflex as you can work up to 40 hours compared to most facilities being a white badge you can't work past 30 hours unless it's peak.,0,t3_cp895n,t2_m5zg8m,ewpvzot,t3_cp895n,t5_1387r9,1565650647,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"But you also have to look at what Amazon is doing. Their pushing for associates to go into IT and machine learning.  They already plan on automating a large portion of their warehouses. Each warehouse is more automated than the next.

In order for Amazon to afford this, they rely heavily on government handouts to keep them developing their automation. Do you honestly think if Amazon built an FC with only 100 workers manning robots there would be no local and state backlash? 

The large amount of taxbreaks are with the promise of jobs. Amazon has even certain demands for some local areas. For example, my FC Amazon pretty much got the city to pay to repave the main road in front of it even though it was still in decent shape. 

Also, it's ""free money."" What corporation wouldn't want to get thrown millions of dollars to build a building that they can test out robotics and find ways to simplify the process?",0,t1_ewp8tf8,t2_2yi1lxy0,ewq5uvy,t3_covzq6,t5_1387r9,1565657592,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Pack high item count and physically small item chutes first unless there's red chutes. More often than not, vet packers in AFE will cherry pick all the good chutes letting newer and inexperienced packers to clean up all the crappy low item count/battery chutes. If you're assigned a side wall, check it relatively often as that's usually where high quantity shipments end up at. AFE packers love to be sneaky and cherry pick those from wall packers.

Other than that, just make sure you're being efficient with pulling and making your boxes. Use dunnage but not too much. You're just keeping the package from collapsing when they're stacked on the trucks and the item shifting too quickly. No need to stuff it completely full. 

If you're still having trouble, ask your PA or AM for coaching to help your rate.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"What I find helps a lot of packers is looking at it as a quota and not as a rate. If your daily rate is 83, simply do that rate times the hours in your shift. You're looking at 830 units packed by end of a regular 10 hour shift. If you know you're not going to get VTO, push hard for that first half until lunch. Shoot for 60-70% of your quota which would be in the 500-600 units range. Then you can take it easy and finish up that second half without having to strain yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For my particular FC (since I don't know if ToT is standardized), I only need to scan 12 units overall which is 1 every 5 minutes to avoid ToT in an hour. I'll usually shoot for 700-800 units (910 being our mixed rate quota) by lunch and spend the second half helping out the water spiders, down stacks or KO and mostly only packing for ToT and when needed for CPTs. Normally I'll still end up around 1-1.2k units for the night but that's not necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also of note, you should never get a documented coaching or write up for a single day that you didn't hit par. Only if you don't make 100% for the week should you be bothered by a PA or AM. Check by your HR kiosk to see if they have an ADAPT terminal or ask your PA/AM to see your ADAPT percentages for the last week or three. That'll give you a good idea of how you're actually performing day over day and week over week.",0,t1_ewdsft3,t2_xy05j,ewrv6fv,t3_cnjgne,t5_1387r9,1565714454,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"This is messed up. I am a safety associate at my site and I can tell you that this is a MAJOR safety issue. This could cause people to overheat if they want productivity to stay at the same level. If they expect people to accept the change then they need to accept that each employee's productivity will drop considerably in order to stay at a safe temperature, but even then ....  


If they made this change in hopes of saving money on water, then I can tell you that it will backfire by causing them to cough up a lot on medical bills.  


At my site, the temperature is commonly between 95 and 100. Because of this, my site has actually increased the amount of water bottles they keep in the building at all times, added some of those tall Coca Cola fridges you see at stores to try to keep our water bottles cold AND make sure there are multiple water dispensers that are either full or have refills nearby. They are also adding insulation on the ceiling in hopes that it will increase the effectiveness of the AC, which is practically useless since the doors are open almost all the time.",0,t3_cq8qhf,t2_17j9e4p8,ewwoni0,t3_cq8qhf,t5_1387r9,1565831630,URL not found

I don't have any definite guarantees, but i've used my medical benefit during one of those LOA's.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I'm not familiar with the UK process, but it all depends on when the building opens.

I transferred to a new FC last year, start date was July 24ish. Then it was was pushed back because the site wasn't ready and I wasn't informed of start date until 10 days prior to starting (Sept. 6th).

They also have to place people and work around people's schedule so they're probably working on who goes where and when before they give an affirmative start date.

If you know the actual date when the site opens and it's getting close, you can reach out to them. There should be a contact number or email at the bottom of the offer.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Headphones or little local speakers for a number of roles would really break up the monotony on the Ship-Dock at my FC. The Inductors in particular are positively mind numbing, and with nobody to even talk to while you're doing it, time passes at a crawl. You're not on the floor potentially in anyone's way, nothing can fall down from above, there's no small sounds to listen for; no reason to not have music or audiobooks while you risk developing a repetitive motion injury.

The other spot that could use music, but probably not headphones, is in trucks (aka Fluid Load). This is a problem with the Max Reach units though. There should be speakers built into the ends not just so that a radio could play through them, but so supervisors don't need to go all the way into a truck to communicate with someone loading. We're supposed to be all about efficiency, but too often we're running around like fools to move people around when we should be able up just intercom to anyone in a given truck through the Max Reach itself, either at a central console or just from the inner end of them.

As much as I'd like it at the Spurs as well (the only other regularly high-population part of the department), it doesn't seem as feasible given the foot traffic.

And I suggest this partly in the knowledge that Amazon has its own music service that associates could be made to use on built-in devices since theft is always a concern, or they could even run a cheap adhoc radio station from a closet in the warehouse for all I care.

I've got other ideas for improvements, but they're more specific to the hardware efficiencies rather than the working conditions.",0,t3_cftcps,t2_arcs5,ewxz1s5,t3_cftcps,t5_1387r9,1565871463,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"What the other person stated is false. 

Did you fill out the resignation form at HR about resigning? You do NOT need to put in a two weeks notice. According to HR, they prefer you do it the day off or a few days before.

If you left in good standing, you are rehirable IMMEDIATELY, you do not have to wait 90 days.

Security caught you, did they take your login info? How long after from the incident did you resigning? If it was immediately after and HR processed the resignation right there and then, security may not have been able to enter the rule break into the system as your name wouldn't show up in the system.

One way to check if you're rehirable, is checking on amazonforce if they have any positions near you, if they do, apply. It will say ""it looks like you worked for us before, we have to check your rehirable.""

If you are, they will send you an email stating you are rehirable and then will ask you to complete your application steps. If not, it will tell you sorry, you are not.

Now, if it says you are not rehirable, you can wait 90 days and try again. Or you may have to wait a year.

Good luck!",0,t3_cr5hvm,t2_2yi1lxy0,ex3dazp,t3_cr5hvm,t5_1387r9,1565983784,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Hey, I’m a DA. Happy to see you’re interested in this role. Entry level Data Analyst roles for most FCs consists of IRDR research and Adjustment research. Essentially you’ll be tasked with determining where defects are coming from and reporting on that, as well as reporting out any significant adjustments where inventory is added or deleted. Most of your job will be working on a computer while also occasionally going out for bin research. 

I personally never had a Data Analyst interview, I transferred from another Tier III role. I would say though know the Amazon Leadership Principles, particularly the ones that are more technical, and have a good story or 2 that follows the STAR method (Situation Task Action Result). You can find all this stuff on the Inside Amazon internal website, HR can definitely guide you there if you’re not sure how to find it.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I'm not sure if all sites do conversion the same way but at my site, when you were able to convert depended on two things.   


First is when they actually needed regular workers. Since seasonal workers come and go (as well as regular workers), they will eventually need some to stay on permanently. When that happens, seasonal workers will receive an email stating that conversions are open and they'll add a link that will stay open for 7 days. Usually you'll get a week or two notice when the conversion week will be.   


Second, it depends on your schedule (or quad as they called it). For example, I was quad A. Basically, right from the start, I was considered on-call and could only work when they personally called me in or when they had VET posted.  


Let me use my personal experience as an example. Me and a co-worker, Shawn, started one day apart but with one difference. He started with a set schedule, but I started as on call. We started on November and by April, he received an email about conversions being open. He applied and forwarded the email to me since I didn't get one. I applied as well but only he was approved. I thought that I may have done something wrong because I am a well known hard worker. I talked to a L4 manager about it and he basically said that quad A workers don't get the same conversion as the others, but the next time they open conversions, I'll be added. Sure enough, 4 months later, they opened conversions again and I was included. I got approved this time since I was actually on the list this time around.  


I hope this helps.",0,t3_cqlbks,t2_17j9e4p8,ex4bxnn,t3_cqlbks,t5_1387r9,1566002314,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"&gt; Just so you know, Water Spiders are an indirect role which is usually rotated around with other people. Its not a permanent job. 

Man, I really think it should be. I only worked at an FC for two weeks (immediately got a better job), and some WS were awesome, running around the floor all day, replenishing boxes without being asked (I was in pack Large and then Medium my 2nd week), and some literally fucking strolled about and would only come when the blue light was hit and sometimes it would take 20-30 minutes, and then they'd ask ""what do you need?"" stopping me from working while I assessed, instead of just filling my boxes.

I hated showing up to work never knowing if I was getting competent badass water spiders or lazy motherfuckers that somehow kept the role anyway.",0,t1_ex9wj21,t2_1rmq08w9,exao7sy,t3_cruzzo,t5_1387r9,1566112045,URL not found

i finished day 3 of picking yesterday i was so miserable 😭 my ambassador kept telling me my takt time was too high and my rate too low, i already wanna quit! i was going as fast as i could and couldn’t break 326 uph  and our goal is 420 😭😭😭 the robots randomly stop/slow down, conveyor jams, some boxes won’t freaking scan or take 2 mins to squeeze out of the pod...and i’m sore as hell! they tell us to focus on quality and not rate our first few weeks but i’m feeling pressured to go super fast and get an 8 second takt!!

i went to pee/drink water and my takt went up by one second i almost snapped when the ambassador complained again lmao. so now i hold it until break but it’s SO hard bc i drink so much water!  

also the building is so damn huge it takes 4-5mins to get to the break room and 2-3 mins to the bathroom!! i feel extra exhausted bc my breaks are technically only 5 mins :(

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If you ever feel like your ambassador is over emphasizing rates over quality, you can go to learning and report it, if you're still new.

When you go get water or to the bathroom, hit the problem menu. It ""locks"" your takt time. It doesn't really after the end of the day, but for current time when they check on their laptops, it shows whatever the screen shows. 

Also pay attention of what stations you're being assigned. For example, if you're picking on the first floor, by the stowers with the large, heavy items, you are more likely to get those items. Keep mental note and make sure you bring it up to a PA or AM whenever you can as often as you can, that way if they give you a write up, you can say that you informed superiors of the issues and they didn't rectify the situation. 

Some floors, uph isn't a big deal. Our FC, the 4th floor the pods would go really slow, so as long as you kept your takt below 7.2ish, preferably under 7, they didn't care. 

A side note, which you really shouldn't do, but sometimes you've wasted too much time, if a box is stuck in the pod and it's been way too long, just sign out and sign back in. It sends the pod away. Do this rarely.

Don't kill yourself there. Your rate picks up naturally. Once you know pod placements, the stations, the floors, it's easier to manage your rate.",0,t1_exbnixu,t2_2yi1lxy0,exc25yv,t3_cruzzo,t5_1387r9,1566142248,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Your rate and times are irrelevant for your first two weeks. After that it escalates on a weekly basis until you hit learning curve. AFAIK you’re suppose to be able to do 275 uph with takt time under 12 at the end of week three. Week 4 jumps up to 360 and take time in 9s. Week 5 is when 400 and 8.5 takt or better matters for pickers in an AR FC. What really matter is your expected productivity percent. Basically that is the number you have to be over 90% of to avoid a wrote up after second week, and you need to have over 100 if you want to be assigned to secondary support roles. 

As for soreness a few things can help. First and foremost get Powerstep PinnacleMaxx insoles (the red ones) for your shoes. Your feet and subsequently the rest of your body will thank you. Get a pair of knee compression sleeves (I use a pair old of socks with the toes cut out) and use a Solimo (Amazon cheap brand) knee brace ver it to save your knees wear and tear. Also get the Mueller wrap around elbow braces, which will help save you a lot of pain and suffer. Get a lifting belt/brace/back support and use it every other shift. Staying hydrated isn’t enough as a picker. Get yourself a 32oz insulated klean kanteen. Fill it one third with ice and use a combination of [Cytomax drink powder ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G72384/) at two scoops to one scoop of [Bodybuilding.com Signature BCAA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CC2R3F6/) and bring three premixed containers of powder mix in the right ratios (Rubbermaid makes small plastic containers that I use) so you can refill at each break. 

Don’t be afraid to take restroom breaks right smack in the middle of your quarters, seriously. With regards to pod gaps, tote conveyor jams, and other issues out of a picker’s control it is helpful to keep a small notebook to log those things down and show it to your PA/AM/OpsM to have your time adjusted for those issues, which then adjusts your expected productivity percentage. 

Ideally you want to stay right around 95% productivity by the time week 4 ends and you’re transfer eligible. If you do too good, then greedy af bonus hungry AMs will do everything possible to keep you as a picker. One woman I know has been a picker at my FC for two years. She hits 600. UPH with TAKT times that are in the 3/s-5/s range no problem, and she has been stuck picking and not given secondary roles because she is just that good at the job.",0,t1_exbnixu,t2_4noia19,exd4i4b,t3_cruzzo,t5_1387r9,1566167029,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Beware of the grass is greener syndrome. Given the work pickers do at an AR FC it gets easy once you build the right muscle memory and muscle coordination. Depending on your location stowers have it worse given they’re pretty much the furthest from bathrooms with them having to walk past pickers cursing the stowers existence when we come across bins that are ridiculously overstuffed to the point stuff falls out of them on to AR floor slowing things down before we get a chance to even touch it or making it impossible to remove safely if at all. Don’t go to stow. Pack could be worse if it is available because a slow packer cam result in the greatest net harm to the most customers experience. Also you will probably get stuck with a greater volume of heavier things to move either there or in a receive process path. It’s shit work, but honestly it gets easier with practice and icing sore muscles and joints after work. Unless you desperately need the money ASAP hold off on taking VET to give your body more time to recuperate.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Your rate is not the number of returns boxes you process, but rather the items inside of them. Each one processed and in a a tote will build your rate. For this, I would use LPN labels as a good measuring of where you’re at, remembering the first one you scan with.

You will see on ReturnApp for dispositions that items are either small or medium/large. Smalls count as 1 item, mediums more. You might think the big items/ones needing more scrutiny will be destroying your rate, but this is rarely the case. Wherever possible, you do want to focus on small packages/envelopes or jiffies, which is just a bunch of smalls in yellow totes. Small boxes are the absolute best to process. They should already be cut open for you.

Do not go in scanning right away. Open the return up and check what’s inside. A quick glance will show you exceptions that you can sideline away without escalating/LPN attachments. Less time spent on something you can’t process.

Start to notice a pattern in what you are processing. Some vendors tend to immediately unsell after the first seal question. Slap an LPN on it, and if you don’t have to remove customer information, you just did an item in 10-15 seconds (tote scan included) when you get the hang of it. 

Sunglasses are typically returned used and have a bunch of fingerprints on them. Things like that. Boner pill documentation that boomers have mistaken for actual Viagra are automatically destroyed. Clothes that people have just rolled up and thrown in a poly bag are unsellable. Company/glossy box has shipping labels on it? Immediately cut off all of the customer info on it and LPN, or guide ReturnApp through the item and see if it’ll become refurb, where you don’t have to remove information. Functional defect/needs testing is the best question on those prompts, if you get customer input (but only on electronics- other things might get you flagged). Returns that scan in as undeliverable generally contain sellable items. Spam through the course of questions that will get to sellable disposition, LPN, yellow tote. Customer accessed swimwear and underwear should be damaged out. Etc.

Don’t stress about anything yet. You have plenty of help all around you. Do not worry about audits, from what I’ve heard (at least at mine) defects and yield don’t typically lead to firing as much as not keeping rate. They are a perfect opportunity for feedback whether you pass or flip.

Keep your head up. I have approached CRETS with the confusion you have here, but I’ve learned something new every day with the help of my Learning/PAs. I have all of the muscle memory down. On a bad day I can hit 100-105% of rate (40/hour at my site).",0,t3_csekiw,t2_48di93sm,exez3il,t3_csekiw,t5_1387r9,1566228848,URL not found

Some locations the warehouse team member role is a catch-all. Depending on what you put for hours and availability, it will show you the options available that best fit. This could be an FC or a delivery station or a sort center. If you really have no preference, they'll put you were there are open positions.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"OB PA and former IB PA with experience working at TNS and softlines

1. Nope, I can say with 99% certainty that there is no policy on leveraging FANS this way. I have experience using different tools in similar ways to automate some functions to free up time for myself or peers.

2. If I was in path, I'd enjoy it. I'd also be skeptical of its accuracy. Just having to press a button to dismiss a message 3 times a day is not something that'd realistically ruin their rates. I might get irked if I almost do a stow not scan because of it though. But yeah, I have heard so many requests for rate to displayed in stowapp since rate is already displayed in pick.

3. As far as the business is concerned, engagements like this will likely only get more common. In pack, quality guided coachings are already automated, and will automatically pause the pack app, and play a little video with bullet points on tips of improving quality. As well as I know a lot of sites require rates posted quarterly now so associates can view on their way to breaks. There are also kiosks even where you can scan your badge and it'll tell you your adapt percent to goal for the day and week.

To outright answer your question though I think its good. I deliver feedbacks and coachings, but I hate it since having the conversation on performance feels dehumanizing especially at the frequency feedback gets generated, but rates are still important for associates to keep track of, so your system seems like a good alternative.",0,t3_csgsr3,t2_ueeie,exfzrl3,t3_csgsr3,t5_1387r9,1566252144,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"So I'm not at an AR facility but I can help with the hydration issue. I know another commenter suggested drink mix but a aren't allowed anything but water on the work floor soooo.

First off I recently read an article that went over a study about hydration. Basically chugging plain water can't hydrate you because it over loads your kidneys so they dump it to the bladder. You can drink less but slower and get more out of it with less pee breaks. Seems roughly true for me- I'll sip water as I get ready for work even and it has zero effect on when I need the bathroom.

That article specifically calls out water devoid of anything else- literally taking a vitamin pill with it slows your body digestion enough to get your kidneys to absorb it. Try drinking non water drinks like Gatorade on break.

Also look up hydration salt pills. Follow the instructions carefully! But if chugging is the only thing that works with you (safe place to put your bottle isn't easily reached) then keep a packet of hydration pills in your pocket.",0,t1_exbnixu,t2_m4oau,exhc3hz,t3_cruzzo,t5_1387r9,1566300626,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The DS setup is particularly brutal in 100+ temps because of the logistics of making sure there is almost unwasted floor space so vans can be loaded from within. I preferred the co-lo setup (vans sat at the docks and were loaded from there, leaving adequate airflow from the fans for the AAs doing the work) but I know the drive behind doing the things the was they are. I get it, I just feel it could be improved for safety. Maybe suggest a change to how any industrial fans are set up so the airflow comes from the front of the building backward where the AAs are most likely to be concentrated... and then suggest fan shift swaps for each new flow on the floor - like, for the early crew, fans can be set up to optimize the airflow around the vans. For the midday crew, it can be optimized at the docks and aisles, for the evening crew it can be pushed from behind the vans coming in to park... again, I have outdated (circa 2017) knowledge on the setup of a DS so... just giving ideas based off my last turn at things.",0,t3_csupfc,t2_je51s,exhlazo,t3_csupfc,t5_1387r9,1566308105,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"the break rooms can have ac but i think it would cost way too much money to be able to have ac throughout an entire warehouse . delivery stations like mine anyhow it would be a waste kind of like leaving the refrigerator or freezer door open too long . it woud require way too much frion or whatever ac is made of just to have to escape out the dock doors 
even Costco only uses fans outside of the offices upstairs and or where the computer servers are 
i dont know about your set up but if its like ours we have 3 BIG ASS FANS in our station and i know because i was the one to break it this last time by pushing that speed of that 3rd fan a little too high it caused all three to go down but only because of a circuit breaker  that got flipped in the electrical box 
the solution to fix it luckily i remember everything and so i knew which box that breaker is located in as it happened the first month i started in the horrible hottest heat wave of summer i watched as they tried to fix it which they finally did.
i just wish they remembered since the shift assistant she was there back in 2017 when it happened but she didnt believe me at first when i said hey its this one over here , remember?
anyhow hopeing you have the same fans and same problem is just a circuit breaker switch that just needs to be flipped back on and you will know when you have the correct one when the digital red lights show again up on the base of the fans.
have to keep all three of our fans at no higher than 85 or it will cut the circuit from overload of using power or something like that",0,t3_csupfc,t2_1ij2u0m1,exho04f,t3_csupfc,t5_1387r9,1566310035,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I used to work at BDL2 in Windsor , CT as a AFE pack associate and it was honestly a mixed bag . I think the worst part was the water thing and having to straddle on dehydration to avoid going to the bathroom too much . They don’t forbid it but it screws with your rate .

I’m most likely the reason Learning curve changed to five weeks because I had a disability that made learning things take a little bit longer so it took longer for me to learn things in my process path . And I ended getting termed for being under rate when I started but I had the feedback held back due to a request on MyAccomadations . That caused feedback to come back up when the case was closed 

I ended up appealing my termination on the basis of said screw up and ended up getting it not only reversed but my entire employement record expunged meaning I’m one of the few people to work at amazon and successfully get an appeal . 

I however would never recommend amazon to anyone , it’s literally slavery without the chains and whips . Hell if it was made legal they would probably use them to help increase rate",0,t3_cjf06o,t2_30y572s1,exp3722,t3_cjf06o,t5_1387r9,1566485343,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"There are a few different insurance options available. The one I have is Premara Blue Cross. $1000 deductible, and Amazon pays half of the deductible every year. So at the beginning of the year Amazon puts $500 in your HRA. You use that to pay for medical services, then you are responsible for the last $500 of the deductible. $2000 out of pocket maximum for the year before insurance covers 100%. Pretty good insurance, I pay a little over $13 every paycheck.

There are wo types of Dental and Vision coverage, basic and enhanced. I pay $1.38 for each every paycheck. Amazon provides life insurance and AD&amp;D, 2x your base salary, at no cost. They also provide short and long term disability at no cost. 

For 401k, Amazon will contribute $0.50 for every $1 you put in, up to 4% of your eligible compensation. Amazon's contributions don't fully vest until after you have worked for them for three years.

For time off, there are three types. Paid vacation accrues each pay period. The accrual rate depends on how many years you've been with Amazon. I can't remember the exact rate for the first year, its 2 hours and so many minutes. I'm about to hit my two year mark and I get a little over two weeks a year. Leftover vacation carries over to the next year, I believe the max you can have is 160 hours. 

PTO is paid time off. This accrues every pay period as well. I can't remember the rate but I believe it  maxes out at 48 hours for the year and stops accruing sometime around June. This doesn't carry over to the following year. Use it or lose it by December 31st.

UPT is unpaid time off. No approvals necessary. This is supposed to be emergency time off but you can use it how you please. You get 20 hours every three months, max you can have is 80. This also carries over to the next year. If you get to a negative balance of UPT, you get fired.",0,t3_cuvmz9,t2_ift0fdi,ey16dg5,t3_cuvmz9,t5_1387r9,1566691034,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"To add on:

The health plans are the same ones that Corporate gets. Premera is based in Washington state but it gets accepted anywhere any other Blue Shield/Blue Cross does. 

I use the Standard Plan. It is quite good. I have had multiple surgeries on it, and my husband had a3-day inpatient ER odyssey on it, and I never had any hassles or questions from them, they just paid that shit. It was great. The prescription plan covers a lot of stuff too.  Once you get employed you get coverage on day one. It’s time to go to your annual physical and all that other shit you’ve been letting go, I think it covers your annual exam 100%.

Dental plan also pays without question, but like all dental plans you have a pretty pitiful limit ($1200/yr I think?). If you have weak teeth or a backlog in care like I did, it’ll take a while to space everything out and bring it up to par.",0,t1_ey16dg5,t2_nfz2f,ey1b3p7,t3_cuvmz9,t5_1387r9,1566694794,URL not found

If the setup is good and staffed correctly with a water spider, you should rarely have much reason to actually leave the station you're at aside from breaks and whatever you need to take care of yourself/station balancing from a PA or PG.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I've done Sort Batch and Pack Single, Sort Batch is pretty much just taking the extra work from Sort Flow to help out AFE. You will be doing one of two jobs depending on the need and what they train you in. Tote wrangle or Rebin. Rate in tote wrangle isn't that difficult to make as long as there is work, should be 100 totes an hour. Can be pretty hectic some days depending on the volume, and whether or not you're doing multilarges or smalls. 

Rebin is sitting at a station and completing orders on a cart, from work brought over by the tote wranglers. You'll have two carts for multismall and one for multilarge. If they put you on it, there is one cart for giftwrap aswell. This is less physically demanding than tote wrangle but can be frustrating in larges. Once complete you queue the work up for packers, or if there is a good waterspider, they'll help you out with that.  You'll find yourself trying to fit in work but can't because the items are too big. Rates there are 250 I believe for larges and 350 for smalls.

Pack single, to me is probably the least active role of the three. You're not exactly supposed to leave your station at all. Aside from breaks or whatever you need to take care of, they want the waterspider assigned to your line to bring boxes and supplies. It can be a bit mind numbing sometimes, just sitting in your station and packing out orders. If they have it setup like my building, you may also ending up doing batch packing if the volume from Sort Batch is enough for additional packers in multis. Rate there, I believe, is 90 in single large and someone mentioned elsewhere that single small/slam at pack is 250(*?*) Not familiar with other setups that have smartpac though.

I feel you on pick and stow though, i'd do anything not to be in either of them. Recently crosstrained into stow myself, and I dislike it so much. It has a very inefficient system.

You will be doing hard labor like building and pulling pallets and building walls in the truck. Indirect jobs like that are less stressful though and the best way to get noticed if you ever want to get promoted.,0,t3_cv8kcy,t2_q7gf41d,ey3i2mu,t3_cv8kcy,t5_1387r9,1566764932,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I just literally went through a situation similar to yours over the past two days; however, I woke up this morning to positive UPT rather than a termination letter. On Saturday I left work for being dizzy due to my meds, and it with the blessings of Site HR saying I wouldn’t receive negative UPT as the meds are prescribed for a disability that I’ve already been seeking accommodation for. For Two days I thought I was fired. 

If the migraines you’re having were already occurring, then you should’ve used the healthcare benefits we receive to visit a doctor and get it checked out and documented. Even if it isn’t a full blown ADA disability HR would’ve used to Dr’s note as sufficient reason to give you a modified schedule if the doctor had requested it. Even here in California where we have the strictest labor laws in the nation for issues like this the law and courts have held that employees have to be proactive about stuff like this, so employers do not have o provide retroactive accommodations for health issues.  I’m saddened to hear about this OP, but hopefully my comments can help someone else in the future avoid these problems. I’m talking shit to HR on VOA boards —that’s how bad we dislike each other— still they can’t get rid of me because I approached my medical issues in a proactive way with good faith. That is the key: be proactive in good faith if you have health concerns. Individual HR folks might not care the least bit about us, but strangely if you follow the Owner’s  Manual you will find out through other resources —ERC and Ethics hotlines in particular— in the book that Amazon as a global megacorp strangely cares.",0,t3_cujhq8,t2_4noia19,ey5pok4,t3_cujhq8,t5_1387r9,1566837420,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Tier 1 are associates. Base pay minimum is $15 (certain areas pay higher). 

Anything above tier 1, you apply for. It's not a gradual step increase. It doesn't matter if you've been there 1 year or 6 years, you have to apply to move up to a new tier.

Tier 2 is usually more administrative/some non-inventory, and some IT helpers (idk the name, but they're not full-fledge techs, just assistants in the IT department). Base pay varies. You need some sort of experience or familiarity with these concepts. These positions hardly ever pop up.

Tier 3 are usually process assistant, yard specialists, other non-inventory, trainers and a few others. Pay is usually $1.50 more per hour. They prefer to see those who have become ambassadors or have become a great resource in their department.

Than after that it's by Levels. Level 4 and above.

Level 4 are usually AMs, learning coordinators, and some facilities have data analysts and program/web developers which can start at this level.

For an AM position, you need a 4 year degree OR at least 2 years experience at Amazon. In order to get to a level 4 with just Amazon experience, they highly prefer you've been a Tier 3. 

Level 5 and up goes more into operations and seniority. Like senior operations manager, site manager, etc. 

There are other jobs I'm not sure what levels there in such as interpreters and data architects. 

So yeah, if you qualify, you apply to whatever tier/level you think fits best.",0,t3_cvpx6x,t2_2yi1lxy0,ey5qmg1,t3_cvpx6x,t5_1387r9,1566838053,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Here is the breakdown of what I chose.

For health insurance I went with Kaiser HMO because there are Kaiser offices and hospitals all over the place near me, and I already have a pre-existing health condition the requires regular visits. They take about $120 per check out for me and a dependent. 

I chose the Delta Dental Enhance (the better of the two options) as I have neglected my dental care for nearly two decades. I also elected to take the VSP Premier (against the second of two options) as I wear eyeglasses and I regular scratch and lose mine. 

They offer all kinds of life, accidental death, critical illness, and similar packages. I went with the third from least expensive for all of the ones we have a choice in. There is “legal” insurance they offer, but in reality it is just very basic single call services, and that is why I declined it, 

Probably the most important thing regarding insurances is if you get a HSA or FSA. Since I know that I’m going to be seeing folks at Kaiser frequently and I will want to upgrade the glasses I get through insurance, and for other things like insoles for work shoes and proper joint braces I opened a FSA account based on the expected copay and maximum deductible  numbers.  For folks without ongoing health concerns they might be better off with a super cheap plan and a health savings account. 

The 401k is administered by Vanguard. Amazon matches fifty cents on the dollar up to a maximum of 2% of your pay. You can choose from about a dozen highly diversified funds, and set traditional or Roth allocation percentages of your total portfolio to each. I choose to go full Roth as I hope that if the planet doesn’t die due to climate disaster that I will be able to make withdrawals 25 years laters without worry about being taxed on my 401k’s performance.  There is a special option to have the Amazon matching contributions go to funds in an Amazon company stock specific fund, That is where I allocated 100% of Amazon’s 2% of my paycheck match. 

The just implemented a new direct stock purchasing plan that is separate from the 401k. Ironically during one of the surveys regarding the on-boarding process and what I thought of the benefit I said bring back restricted stocks and create an additional way for employees to own a part of the company with additional deduction options to buy stock. You can have up to $1900 (a theoretical near max gross check for tier 1 associate) deducted from each paycheck to purchase shares of AMZN directly. I took the current share price and divided it by 28 (number f pay periods in a year) to ensure that I could acquire around 1 year this year, and next year I will probably do the same for two shares, etc. That works for me, for yoU who knows. 

There is a discount code they give you that for $1000 worth of purchase we receive 10% off our Amazon.com purchases, which is essentially $100 per year extra to spend at company store. This actually pisses me off. I get that being frugal is a leadership thingamajig at Amazon, but a higher limit (say 10% of pay, would mean less turnover as then it would be a powerful benefit given the wide range of things we sell. Also the 10% does not work for primenow deliveries of food from either primenow facilities or Whole Foods. That would be a nice addition, because even how many hours we work at Amazon it would be nice if we could enjoy some of the healthiest foods available and have a more efficient use of our leisure time to do other things as we wouldn’t be driving to and from the grocery store etc. Amazon would actually end up making more money. Also we don’t get a free Prime membership, which honestly we should, because to best understand how to make the customer experience be the best as possible it helps to actually have a lens of truly being a customer. Seriously, Amazon should make all digital subscription service like Prime, Twitch Turbo, Audible, Amazon Music free to all employees during our tenure.",0,t3_cuvmz9,t2_4noia19,ey5toq9,t3_cuvmz9,t5_1387r9,1566840090,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"I will just add to this since it covers most. 

Tier 1-3 follows a step plan of raises every 6 months until 36 months and then you are capped. These vary by location so I cant say exact numbers. However when you get promoted (usually 1 to 3) you will lose your step plan and have to start at the bottom of the new higher plan. 

Tier 1-3 are building specific but the same for everyone in that building regardless of job. my building has a $4 difference between 1 and 3 but it varies a lot.

Level 4 does have hourly spots but they are usually specific spots and not common. Tom team area manager, data analyst who got promoted, some hr/learning/ safety spots, and more that I dont know about. 

Level 4 and up varies a lot and 2 people in the same position and building can have different pay and stock bonuses based on their offer/contract. It also varies alot by position, for example a regular level 4 area manager could make 50k but a software developer level 4 could make 90k.",0,t1_ey5qmg1,t2_q7gf41d,ey5w7b7,t3_cvpx6x,t5_1387r9,1566841764,URL not found

Yeah. I was with Amazon for almost two years, because of the $15 increase (right before my 1 year) I did not get a raise. However, our location stated Tier 1s would not get a raise for at least a year. From what I heard, the step plan would be site specific because certain areas have lower cost of living and the $15 exceeds that.

And for the tier 3, I was disappointed when I found out I'd be a PA making only $1.50 more and if I switched to day PA shift it would have been less than I was making as a Tier 1. =/

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If I were you, i'd broaden my scope. I get that you want to get into IT (which is actually extremely easy), but there are many **many** different avenues within Amazon that can take you there. If you already have a degree in an IT-related field, just apply for the IT positions. You should probably provide more information as to what you actually want to do within IT, since it's so broad. If you're going into Operations, your career path is going to look a lot different from people who are IT Techs or Support Engineers (both work in FC's, Engineers can be L4 thought and hourly) that aren't on a direct path for Operations. Sure, they can be the IT manager at some point, but most likely they won't without a degree, or without a lengthy tenure with Amazon.

FC Operations positions are shit if you aren't a good leader, so I think it's of utmost importance that you evaluate your interpersonal strengths and ability to inspire, motivate and lead people who look at most AM's as ""fresh out of college"" lazy bums who have no prior work experience; mean, I know, but this is the absolute truth even though most won't say it to you. As someone else pointed out, also consider positions that aren't local; if you have the ability to relocate, this will grant you great power in attempting to find a position, and will be seen as favorable to Amazon as well. Relocation packages are pretty good depending on the position/level.

If I was in your shoes? I'd look into Amazon Web Services along with the FC positions, perhaps even consider the many affiliates of Amazon (doesn't matter even if it were Whole Foods, you'd still be in Amazon's systems officially). 

It sounds like you have a lot of freedom with choosing where you land, so I would choose either locations in Washington that are close to Seattle, Oregon that is near PDX, California (Bay Area); these locations have a great mixture of FC's as well as Amazon affiliates, and Amazon Web Services, and even some corporate offices that focus primarily on tech/IT related functions. 

If you simply cannot make up your mind, AM positions are a dime a dozen and the easiest to get into; and with a soon-to-be Masters, you could be fast-tracked for Senior Ops positions, L6 and above.


tl;dr - West Coast is the best for opportunity to get your foot in the door in terms of the diversity of positions. Operations positions are fine, but you're probably limiting yourself if you wanted a more direct and technical role in IT (you're what they would refer to as ""over qualified"" even though that's kind of cliche to say; I say this because most of the people in technical roles in the FC or DC don't have degrees, and in the DC most even started as temp agency hires with zero experience). You have two options, go into a technical role and once you have your masters, you can basically skyrocket into higher positions; or you can utilize your Bachelors and go into Operations without gaining the grunt work experience. If I were you, i'd choose starting from the ""bottom;"" within just a few years I 100% guarantee you will have experiences that make you a better choice over everyone else.",0,t3_cwaohr,t2_11p1ke,eycm2v0,t3_cwaohr,t5_1387r9,1567003841,URL not found

To start, My bachelors is in Criminal Justice and Public Admin. I have about a year and a half of my masters program left. This winter/ next spring I planned getting A+, Network +, And Security + certs. The thing is that I am lacking experience in the IT field.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"So this is what I would do, but first i'll tell you what I think would end up happening if you went the AM route.

You'll go in as Level 4 and by the time you get your masters you'll be L5 and with your masters, most likely will be simple for you to get L6 and be in line ahead of others for Senior Ops positions at L7 and all of the Director/Regional positions that are normally reserved for people with 7+ years of experience in Amazon or Masters degrees; i'm basing the 7+ years on GM/Site Lead positions i've seen posted and they've required 7 years or a Masters.

Going down this road is basically all you'll ever know; no grunt work, no technical work, you're basically at a desk and you have no real interaction with the day-to-day. It's not to say you'll have none, our lead came and joined us here and there, but it's so minuscule in the grand scheme of things it's not worth mentioning. You probably won't find yourself in an IT position going this way unless they let you downgrade your level so far to the point of L3 without any serious level of experience for L4 hourly positions in IT in the FC. 

In your position, I think applying for Data Center Technician positions would be a good idea. AWS is *always* expanding and opportunity is abundant. Build your own home server, start building your own computers, and become familiar with brands such as Juniper, Quanta, Cisco, Adva, Synnex-Hyve, ZT; if you become familiar with those brands, you will be beyond a solid prospect for any recruiter if you're able to slap on your resume. Perhaps take courses that pertain how a DC functions and how hosts function; like the other poster said, how to troubleshoot, troubleshooting is a large portion of what techs do, and it will pay dividends if you possess that type of knowledge. Even then, I was not exaggerating when I said almost all techs started as temp agency hires that converted to full time. Some had prior knowledge, a lot didn't and they learned on the job, there are even classes AWS provides people who aren't even techs to learn what a tech does, all for the sake of expanding their knowledge.

If you go that route and go in as L3, you'll probably promote to L4 in a year, and then by the time you're up for another annual review you should have your masters, and at that point with the experience you gain you will be a prime prospect for DC Manager positions. Managers here compared to the FC is night and day in terms of how professional people are and the quality. 

If it's something that interests you, I guarantee you won't regret it. It's a great environment, extremely professional and friendly, and everyone is about your personal growth. 

Also, before I forget; some DC's don't even have an IT department because the techs are the DC's own IT. Opportunity is abundant in AWS.

Best of luck!",0,t1_eydikwp,t2_11p1ke,eydl5dl,t3_cwaohr,t5_1387r9,1567020557,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"I have a bachelor's in computer information systems. I applied to amazon as a temp job just so I had something to pay the Bill's right out of school. Ended up liking it and decided I wanted to stay and try to move into IT.

After failed attempts to get into IT I ended up in transportation for a bit cause that is what I got offered and wanted the raise. 

I was working on my A++ to try again for IT when I found out about the data analyst position. Ended up applying to a position for it with a new building launch and had an informal interview about it. I got the spot and even though it wasent any more money I'm excited to get back into something involving my degree. I am relocating but they gave me a nice bonus for the move and I was looking to get out of where I was living anyways.

Currently I am planning to either learn some machine learning to move into data science or learn AWS to get into that field. This will all be on my own time ofcourse but amazon's career choice does allow you to take some classes %95 paid by amazon. I think I might need to study up on networking to get into AWS though, since my background isn't very strong with networking concepts. 

I am not a strong manager, it's just not who I am. I could and did manage teams in retail but I hated it so i am more trying to learn skills versus move up in management.

If you want to get into FC support type roles I strongly recommend A++ and network++ certs. Amazon loves those and even requires support techs to get an A++ within 6 months of hiring. 

As far as interviews go all management interviews will follow the amazon STAR. They ask situational questions and expect in this situation I had this task so I took this action and had this result stories. For IT interviews this will be way more knowledge checks to make sure you know what you are doing. You will have 2 sets of interviews typically and the 2nd one will be the heavier knowledge check one with 2 people asking in depth how to do something style questions.

I would strongly suggest not going the route I took and start in IT or management. It is very hard to get noticed in the thousands of base level workers regardless of my previous management and schooling.",0,t1_eydi6ax,t2_q7gf41d,eydlfkw,t3_cwaohr,t5_1387r9,1567020699,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If you didn't have any PTO left, then you would've been caught in a trap that is designed to weed people out.

In AtoZ you request the first 4 hours of the shift to be UPT and you use 45 mins of PTO after that until your normal lunch break. Then you apply another 4 hours of UPT from your lunch break and then you cover the remainder of shift with 1 hour 15 mins of PTO (or 5 hours UPT and 15 mins PTO).",0,t3_cwtr1e,t2_4noia19,eyjyw1q,t3_cwtr1e,t5_1387r9,1567132021,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I work in an Amazon Robotics FC. I haven’t worked in any other buildings, so I cannot answer your question from first hand experience. From what I’ve read the most difficult buildings are the Heavy Fulfillment Center where they have items that are over 30lbs. Next would probably be any of the AR FC’s that provide same day delivery (not primenow). I think then he traditional old school warehouses are next. Sort centers, delivery stations, Amazon Fresh buildings, and primenow hubs wpuld be easier than the aforementioned buildings. Whole Foods would be the easiest of the places that involve a lot of physical labor. Also there are buildings that are connected to airports that I think are probably slightly more difficult than sort centers. 

I pick in an AR building. It isn’t easy work by any stretch of the imagination. I’m expected to pick a total of 4000 items per shift. Moving that fast for 10 hours at a time requires a tremendous amount of endurance. We are expected to change our totes in 3 seconds. The fastest method generally involves having the currently picked item in the tote and swinging it to push to full tote onto the conveyor system.  Basically pickers in an AR FC will be swinging 20lb weights around all day. On top of that we are expected to be able to read the pick screen and determine which item and quantities and from which specific bin, then grab the item and put it in the specific tote in about 8.5 seconds. That requires shuffling around just like a soccer player. If there is an item that is “missing” from a bin we are supposed to take all of the items out of the bin, scan then one by one, put them back in the gin better than the stowers did, and basically as a good learning ambassador told me, “risk our jobs when we hit the missing item button.” We don’t get any adjustments to our time and rate for those issues. AFAIK the only people with a higher rate in the company are smartpac packers. Also I have never seen a more fit group of people not directly engaged in an athletic activity or at the gym than I have with AR FC pickers.",0,t1_eyjgbjq,t2_4noia19,eypsfha,t3_cruzzo,t5_1387r9,1567309722,URL not found

Treat it as any other regular interview, but you're going to need several stories to pull from, and you're going to need to expertly craft those stories into the STAR method. 

It really honestly always comes down to your stories, because your stories are the things that explain to the interviewers what you're actually about, this is why they need to be extremely detailed and convey *who and what you are made of* .

When they debrief and go over their notes, you need to be thinking about what you want them to be discussing with what you gave them.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I wear sketchers, but to each their own. I probably would not recommend them as a first pair. However, a pair of good socks also makes a difference. 

The purpose of ICQA is to make sure all items are accounted for and to verify quantity. For example, a picker hits an item is missing, eventually it makes its way back to a counter who verifies if it is actually missing.

I believe you do have a rate, but it goes by quality? In our building they hired about 15 counters in one swoop, and most of them were let go. They had too many errors. Errors can be you counted too many or too little what the computer had which was later verified by another counter. You counted incorrect bins. Another one which got a two counters sacked in our department was that if a picker put an item missing in the bin, the counters would grab the item from another bin and put it into the first bin and say it was there. 

We usually would have hard candy (lollipops, caramels, jolly ranchers) and sometimes snack size of chocolate or almonds for a boost of energy. We also would bring those energy powders to mix into water.

As a counter, you are usually cross-grained at some point to another process. Most of ours are pick as well and a few do stow. You can talk to a manager, once you familiarize yourself with your process, to see if you can become an ambassador. It shows initiative and looks better if you plan on moving into more leadership roles.

PA are tier 3s which you would have to apply for. AMs and Operation managers are Level 4s and above which require a degree or at least two years of experience.

You can always ask to be cross trained, become an ambassador, or learn problem solve. ICQA is pretty easy, but very boring. 

Good luck!",0,t3_cykgb3,t2_2yi1lxy0,eytdh8h,t3_cykgb3,t5_1387r9,1567433544,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. Amazon Employees get a discount at Sketchers and they have some pretty comfortable shoes.
2. ICQA is in charge of ensuring the accuracy of the contents of the FC's inventory. You're counting the bins to make sure that everything the inventory system thinks is there is actually there. Stuff falls out and people make errors so it's never perfect
3. There is a rate for SBC (it varies by FC) but while you're new to the process, you're not expected to hit it yet. There is no learning curve for quality so make sure that you're absolutely sure every time you enter the the number on your scanner. Ask a member of leadership what the rate expectation is so you know where you need to be after you finish learning curve.
4. My FC let's you have hard candy on the production floor but that's it. Another question to ask a leader!
5. Your direct path (ICQA) can lead to some indirect roles. These don't pay more but they are the first step towards getting promoted. Some of the options for ICQA are:
Problem Solver- Correct defects found in bins, audit expiration dates, etc
Damage Land- check in damaged products and store them for later sale
Amnesty Floor Monitor- Resolve problems on the robotcs floor and pick up fallen products (my favorite)
Ambassador- train new hires, transfers, and cross-trainees in ICQA
These don't lead directly to promotions but they give you the experience you need to stand out when you apply for promotions.",0,t3_cykgb3,t2_r97wv,eytewxz,t3_cykgb3,t5_1387r9,1567434716,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"lmao

Sorry, honestly couldn't help but laugh at that one, you did kind of shoot yourself in the foot with the safety aspect. 

Despite what the media portrays, Amazon does care very much so about safety; the only time they sacrifice ""safety"" is for ""business need,"" but those are rare exceptions to the rule. Safety is one of those things that you'll hear all of Operations harp about, and is the only thing that can cause the entire building to shut down permanently (Outbound at least, like lightning near the trailer yard), or temporarily (safety stand-downs if there are X-number of safety incidents a day). 

tl;dr - yeah you kinda fubbed it; safety is their #1 priority.",0,t1_eytn6w9,t2_11p1ke,eyttdxb,t3_cyqxkb,t5_1387r9,1567445193,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"ive worked for Vons/Safeway and Ralphs and did carts in the 1990's and started work at Costco in 2003 and did merchandising which is stocking in the morning and moving pallets of stuff around on a pallet jack
and my experience and observations and opinons are 
a. the grocery carts were way heavier in the 90's than they were in 2006 and 2007 (i did work both grocery stores twice ) 
Costco was hard physically but at least i was allowed to run in their warehouse - this is not allowed at Amazon which sucks

My full time job prior to working at an Amazon Sort Center was sitting on my ass all day scanning various city documents and prepping those documents to be scanned and then data entry. 

working at Amazon in my opinion and because I tend to be a hard worker although also learning to work smarter not harder 
has been by far hands down the hardest job physically so far. It doesnt have to be though. 
I don't know how it works in the FC's but in the warehouse I work in if you make rate and get buddy buddy with your manager you can get promoted fairly quickly and then the more you work your way up the less work you have to do physically",0,t3_cysnmi,t2_1ij2u0m1,eyu8fu1,t3_cysnmi,t5_1387r9,1567455584,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"There are two things you can do. Your managers and HR can't really do anything until you've initiated one of the following options and when you do they are the ones that approve/deny the request.

1: Transfer to a different shift. Usually you'll have to go into schedule on A to Z and see if your site has transfers available, if they do not, you can wait until they open up transfers. If they do, apply to a night/RT shift for the process you'd like. Certain FCs also have weekend only(part-time) shifts. These are two 10s.

2. Do a schedule accommodation. This has to be done in an Amazon facility computer. You will go on A to Z, then scroll down to resources, and it should say schedule accommodation. Before you do this, email yourself a copy of your school schedule. You will have to upload it as proof. You will put your site and reason (school). In order for accommodation to be approve, you have to put in 30 hours. You can put it in however you want(most of the time) as long as it's minimum 30 hours. It can be 3 10s from 6pm to 4am a Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday. Or you can do 2 twelves and an 8. Or 6 five hour shifts. 

FYI working OT while being a full-time student is a bit hard. Trying to take an exam at 9am after getting at 7am is brutal.  So if you go with the second option look at your study habits, your school and sleep schedule, and what work schedule works for you carefully.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It really depends on the trainer honestly. The class is pretty simple as it pretty much boils down to just common sense and learning about the center of gravity and the stability triangle to keep from tipping over. In the class they will also go over what ever additional rules they have for the building (rules that other Amazon buildings might not have for PIT). For example, in my building whenever a PIT is in use you must have a spotter unless your in this one little section but, in other buildings you don't need a spotter at all. The practical training is pretty straight forward as they'll go over how to operate, let you drive around, perform the function of the PIT until you feel comfortable some trainers will give you time until you feel confident however, that may not always be the case. When it comes to rate for PIT, the rate will probably be adjusted for PIT or they may not have any rate at all and classify it as an indirect function. Any idea of what PIT equipment they could be using?",0,t3_czkohj,t2_3lhnjglz,eyza5s7,t3_czkohj,t5_1387r9,1567613086,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"My building doesn't have those. But, for those the training I would think will be more intense and thorough as those pose a bigger risk than the usual PITs (forklift/electric pallet jacks). For that they'd have 3 parts (PIT 101, Fall Protection, and Cherry/Order Picker specific class). PIT 101 is the generic class and test that all PIT drivers regardless of which model they will be operating has to go through. Fall Protection class is what all aerial lift PIT operators have to go through (putting on the harness, etc.). Then the Cherry Picker class will focus on the function, operation, and rules pertaining to it. They should knock it all out in one go but just know it's probably gonna be 3 tests and 3 PowerPoints. These are my beliefs being PIT trained for multiple models and seeing that Fall Protection is it's own thing on the back of my License.

It being 2019 shouldn’t have any influence on whether or not cellphones are allowed. You are being paid to work, not be on your phone. What is so important that you feel you should have it on you? If there is an emergency, you can still be reached, though it might take a bit longer than just ringing your personal phone. I know of plenty of jobs that would write you up for being on your phone. 

Also, most people with AirPods have an Apple Watch and listen to music or podcasts while they work. I guess this depends on where you work.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"All bs because then no one would be able to have them since everyone higher than a t1 has the same access to everything a t1 has access to. Also most positions at an FC don’t even have a customers address visible to them. Also brings back to my original point that they are allowing random people tours with phones. If they were so concerned about trade secrets and the security of their customers why are they doing that?

People have a lot of personal things on their phones. If it gets stolen then it is a haste to deal with. In fact it’s at a point to where people don’t even have to remember phone numbers anymore because they rely on them being available to them. A lot of people have children they have to call and check on while they are at work. It is extremely inconvenient to have to walk 5mins to the front of the building go through security and get your phone just to check on them when you could just have your phone nearby and enjoy your full 15min break.

Like you said earbuds are allowed at certain facilities, but even that was flagged as a safety violation by the higher ups at the facility I worked at.

T3s are based upon department and job requirement as well as building rules. My current building the PAs are not allowed to have a cell phone at all, but maintenance is. This happens because of different departments have different needs for communication.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Material handlers are T1s in the Procurement (Non-Inventory) department, and work with the T3 Non-Inventory Clerks to move supplies from trucks to various areas around the building. What I’ve seen, that primarily means boxes, jiffies, tape, and SmartPac rolls for AFE and Pack Singles, but also other stuff, like hand sanitizer and gloves.

It’s a physical job where you’ll be dragging around palette jacks a lot, and your department will be rather small. Probably a lot better than being a regular T1 associate tho, because there’s no rate, and once you’ve unloaded and staged everything, you’re more or less done until the supply truck arrives.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Being an Area Manager (AM) is a pretty awesome job. It has its challenges but also its rewards. The technical side of the job isn't that hard, you really just pick it up over time. Managing someone twice your age who's angry at the world because they're working for $15 an hour and they have 2-3 different AMs a year is the real challenge. You get to know a lot of good people and get really good insights on how operations can be changed for the better by just about everybody who will work for you and with you. Standing out as a manager can be difficult at times especially if you're on night shift but you'll get projects as you gain some tenure. I recommend you at least apply. Having the ability to live pretty much anywhere in the country, manage 100+ people, make good money, have tons of upward mobility and have access to real change on the side of a trillion dollar company is something only Amazon can give you.

This can be done either in person with your manager or via a white board which should be set up at each stand up area for people to jot down when they are leaving early. So long as you give at least 60 minutes warning then ATO is approved. 

After a month you are out of learning curve and have are expected to hit rate. Even if you are killing it your expected rate is set by how the building is doing overall.

You can be fired for not hitting rate consistently but it goes through an escalation process to get there and there will be coaching available to help you improve your numbers.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"As a general rule EVERY T1, no matter the department, is paid the same Base Rate.

Some sites have what's called a ""shift differential"" which offer bonus pay on top of your Base Rate. An example would be an extra $0.50 per hour for all nights associates, or $0.25 per hour for all associates whom work both weekends (Sat and Sun).

This could mean a raise, but not because you are going to non-inventory, but instead to (possibly) a different shift, if your site offers shift differentials.

comment,AmazonFC,1,hi manager here. if any of our employees leave early they are better leaving without telling us or when youre in stand up just write your name on the board under leaving early section. cuz once you clock out it boots you off the system that way you are not effecting our labor. i know many FC are strict but ours we try to keep it simple and 9/10 we're not worried if u r gone but if we need to find u thats only because maybe you forgot a tote or overflow for one of the routes you picked n staged. And also if you leave early youre helping us out pon labor therefore we dont need to adjust unless if it slows down n theres really nothing to do then VTO lol,0,t1_ezph62u,t2_m5zg8m,ezvkv47,t3_d1jn9f,t5_1387r9,1568182469,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Hello ! Flow AA here. At Flow, we do a lot in terms of making sure the building is flowing and have no roadblocks. Calling out jams, labor sharing, excel spreadsheets, dropping troubleshoot tickets, and the list goes on. At Flow, I feel like it’s a lot of responsibility but unless you’re an ops manager, you won’t go deep into any planning like they do. Flow requires two people. An Ops Manager and an AA.

As the tier 1 or tier 3 AA, your job is to basically do what I listed earlier in this post. I have a background in all roles in AFE, especially problem solve, so that’ll help you get into flow if you want to get into it. 

Just know that once you’re in, they expect you to learn quickly because the building is essentially in your hands and you gain a lot of power. I shut a wall by accident and caused a sev2 !

That part is different depending on the building.  I do work closely with my Ops so that they're in the loop on everything, but I do preshift plan and run start of shift meeting, cover flow changes at sync, do all the decision making during shift, make the volume to plan callouts to our Sr Ops, and write the outbound end of shift wash.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Check the job finder through the hub (AtoZ) from any computer at your site (job finder is not accessible outside of the Amazon network) search for jobs you’re interested in and submit your resume and application for the job. 

To prep for an interview learn the STAR interview format. Failure to follow this format will automatically result in not being offered the position. 

If you’re interested in ops tech IT check out the associate to tech program if there’s no position for an L3 tech

For process assistant , learn the amazon leadership principles. Design your interview answers to show/demonstrate your knowledge of the leadership principles. 

Ask your manager to do a mock interview if you like, lots of people do. 

FYI, being inclined doesn’t mean you have the job, it only means if there’s a position available for you within the next 90 days you will get an offer.

Basically you watch the cameras and numbers all day and try to dictate which way work and headcount should go. For example you may decide there are too many stow problem solvers and move one to a station to make the projected goal. Also you need to make the hour update email that include all the numbers for Inbound after the hourly PPR update. You also decide what stow floors run what freight and what reactives go where.

Simply having the highest rate or being the hardest worker doesn't mean they know how to solve problems or have difficult conversations with people.

its the same as when power goes out in a room or part of your house when something like putting the wrong light bulb in a lamp will trip the breaker , just have to flip it back on outside where your electrical panel is.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The best way that I can explain it is, if you know how algebra works you should be fine. For the most part you’ll be dealing with rate and numbers of associates. Example, I have 7 associates who can pick at 150, that means I can pick ~1,050 units per hour.
9 times out of 10 you’re given two out of three variables and you’re expected to be able to extrapolate the third from the first two.

A * B = C, where you’re always given two of the three.
If you can do that you should be just fine.",0,t3_d5nemj,t2_bctgz,f0nd7ec,t3_d5nemj,t5_1387r9,1568766966,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. The math is pretty basic. You’re mostly using the rate of your associates multiplied by the number of associates. You will use this across pick, pack, and ship dock for example to ensure all departments has work, flow is kept to normal levels, and you ship out everything in the required time. Most the of planning is done in excel where all the math is done through macros. 

2. No it’s not anywhere near as bad. But it does depend on your ops, Senior leadership, and the building type. The work life can suck, you’ll be working one weekend day and possibly nights. But the job it self it’s easy for the most part. You will walk a lot. There is a good amount of pressure to not suck. Other than that you’ll be engaging, planning, and leading a large team. 

3. Yes. If you want to work hard, jump in with the associates you will earn trust and gain a lot of respect from your team. If you’re willing to commit and learn you can be successful.",0,t3_d5putp,t2_13q87h,f0nhiwo,t3_d5putp,t5_1387r9,1568770246,URL not found

The job is to manage headcount, slot the right people into the right jobs, make sure they are doing the jobs, and occasionally get your hands dirty doing front line work when headcount isnt enough to cover current need.

How good or bad it is depends, like so much in life, on the people involved. Is there pressure? Oh yes. Is there a time crunch? Always. Are the rates ambitious? Yup. All of these things tend to stress people; all of these things tend to bring out the worst in people.

comment,AmazonFC,1,That's bad advice. Just because you haven't had anything happen doesn't mean it won't to others. At my station white badges get terminated automatically if you miss a shift without saying so on the hub,0,t1_f0mpux3,t2_23luoa5y,f0pqdhf,t3_d56di7,t5_1387r9,1568842973,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"With Amazon I go with advising policy first. Then give my realistic experience. Lots of places in the network don't follow policy perfectly. But policy is the best practice to follow so that you don't get terminated for something stupid if they change things. They don't do anything at your center, but all it would take is a diff manager who follows policy and you could get fired...

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Sometimes, Amazon will decide to do a mandatory overtime day, otherwise known as MET. As the name implies, this day is a mandatory day and is treated like any other scheduled day. You will be notified at least 24 hours in advance, at both your facility and through SMS alerts and the hub. 

If you don’t show up, you need either UPT, PTO or if you absolutely cannot work that day, talk to HR and you may get an exception. YMMV. 

It rarely gets called, except for during peak or when there is just a whole lot of work to get done, so don’t worry too much.

Before this changed, I was stowing after around 120% and now I’m around 90-105%. Of course this depends on what items I am to stow on that particular day.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It’s going to be a totally different experience than working at a DS. If you end up in Pick, Stow, or ICQA (unlikely for a new transfer), you’ll be at a fixed station with a cushy rubber ergo mat with (in my biased opinion) a much better UI and scanning interface.  Your rate will be determined more by economy of small/medium sized movements rather than running around the put racks hucking boxes, and there’s much more coaching and care available regarding your ergonomics. 

Also, air conditioning. 

Personally I find Pick easiest, though I haven’t picked on the newest stations which are even easier to use.  Stow is a strange process path; most people struggle in it but there are a golden few who are wizards at it regardless of the mix of product they are brought.

also there are more ergonomical ways to scan and the best way was initially scanning the package while it was still on the conveyor belt but that got thrown out the window with ergonomics. 

perhaps it will take some nudging from me to the beast to get them to let up on their steps of doing sort and just stow all the packages where they go first and then scan them all in Flow Mode not trickle. if those even show up still as options as I recall the software has changed a little bit.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I have tried so hard to solve the major problems and have come up with solutions one of which a prior manager stole and took credit for and turned it into a twisted version position called stow buffing which cut in half the time it was taking our shift to do the volume we had been doing. 
I give up. I feel like we are in the freakin twilight zone or planet of the freaking apes. My Gosh for people who aren't actually doing the work us tier 1 associates are doing they sure think they know a fucking lot about how to get it done best. 
Just because you are great with math and passed geometry doesn't make you a great plumber because you can make calculations on paper.
Just like you can't just see how many jiffies you can scan in a whole entire minute (ooh a whole sixty freaking seconds wow) and then multiply that result by 60 and say that is a totally reasonable scan rate. 
Well unless you are a marksman and can do it the same exact way everytime , but don't hold your breath because you can hold it for 1 minute does not mean that you can hold it for an hour (without an oxygen mask anyhow) 
There is one variable 
And it is called SHIT 
and it happens a lot. 
Now perhaps if we could pair up in pairs and run sort as a relay race or something so we can come up for air or water it could work. 
But heavens no. That might require some team work. 
Yes team work. 
This job was fun when it felt like playing a team sport. 
Practice makes for perfect

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I work in receiving at a normal FC (not large items). More specifically, I work in what is called decant. However, supposedly this is a new position that the new design FCs have (mine just opened a few weeks ago). So if you happen to be starting at a brand new FC that was just built, you're almost guaranteed to be put there, if they keep you in that department. If you're referring to your hiring documents saying ""FC Receiving"" as your department, be aware that that could change. Mine said ""FC receiving"" and so did someone else's that was starting at my FC that I met on this sub. I was actually put there, but the other guy said they put him in stow on day 1. So don't be surprised if it changes. 

Anyways, decanters basically just put items into totes. You're at a station and you take a box off a conveyor belt (that was just unloaded from a truck at an inbound dock), scan it, open it (unless it's a single case), put the item or items in a tote, and scan the tote. There is a little computer screen that you use (for instance, totes can't be over 25 lbs). In general you try to fill up the tote, and then you push it down a thing where it goes on another conveyor belt and is taken to the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th floor to the stowers. Oh yeah, and a few people are basically recruited to be problem solvers or counters in decant too in the very first week, if your FC is a new launch. Those positions seem pretty easy. 

Anyways, I actually think decant might be the best department to work in. I've only done that, stowing (I've cross trained on that), and I've helped waterspider for stowers, but I still think it's the best one. (I've also watched pickers and packers.) It's less tedious and boring than stowing, mainly because you're in much closer proximity to other people, you don't feel alone. There is someone standing right across from you at your station, and somebody else right on the other side of the conveyor, so people can even talk a bit. Also, you don't have to stoop down and go up ladders like pickers and stowers do. Everything is right in front of you. Everyone in the department actually seems to like it, and everyone gets fairly mad when we have to work other jobs. 

I can go into more detail about this if you want, but like I said, your facility may not even have decant, especially if it's not a new launch FC, or if it's a large item building. So I don't want to write a whole book about it if that's the case I guess...",0,t3_d7d5cx,t2_ubzzk,f11yx1p,t3_d7d5cx,t5_1387r9,1569132497,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,2,"There is a program where Amazon teaches you in software development and you have to go to a campus in Seattle for 3 months (or is it 6?). This is all through Amazon itself, HR doesn't really know much about it.

Some of the courses are available online, however, it's not guaranteed you'll have a placement afterwards. You have to be an Amazon employee for at least a year to take advantage of technical academy.

You have to search for it in AtoZ under resources. I wish I could remember the name of it.

It's easier to find on that webpage that pops up beside AtoZ on an Amazon computer. It shows like news and stuff. You put technical academy on the search bar and it pops up.

There are also free python, Java, and other coding self-paced courses. Available to any employee, regardless of tenure, I believe. I took the python one. It's pretty decent.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"@ Jarraf......... I ""voluntary resigned"" ... termination as well, but for a different matter. I got that SAME letter via email and in myDoc.

I applied a month later because of ............... within two weeks, I got the same f/t position, but at a different Fulfillment center. Go figure. However, I don't smoke.

The other thing is, IF you can apply again and work at a different FC, aren't they going to come after you for ""random"" drug testing .......??

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It is a Nationwide program.

The technical academy is NOT related at all to career choice. Career choice is completely different and with a third party Amazon hires to teach employees.

The technical program is for any employee willing to do it Nationwide. You will just have to relocate to Seattle for it or you can take the course online. HR isn't really familiar with the details with it 'cause it's corporate.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I really wish I could remember the website.

But sometimes when you log in to the computer and AtoZ pops up there's another webpage that pops up it gives you Amazon/FC news and topics. (You can also find it on resources under something news.net? I don't remember)

Well, when you're on that news/blog type webpage search technical academy. When I first saw it, it was on the front page that's how I found out about it.

It should give you a few search results. Click on the most relevant one.

You would have to email or call what's listed there for more information.

You can usually sign up right there as well as long as you meet the requirements. The Seattle campus program is twice or three times a year. You will have to apply before a set deadline. 

The self-paced one you don't have to travel. You get a certificate of completion if you complete during a certain time frame. But campus is the way to go as it's easier to get placed after.

HR doesn't facilitate because it's a corporate thing. It's meant for associates to become developers and not work at an FC.",0,t1_f179k4f,t2_2yi1lxy0,f17b1vl,t3_d7q5b8,t5_1387r9,1569239961,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"At my site there are 5 different jobs that are all bound together as ""outbound dock"". Half of those do not have an individual rate, the rate is for the department as a whole.

You are rarely locked into a single job for an entire shift, they move everyone around constantly to be deal with the type of volume coming down the line at the time. An example is that they may take people off palletizing and move them to flats, then take some guys off fluid load and throw them at trans, then move them to palletize... etc.

You are rarely locked into a single task at a single station. There are also lots of indirect roles if that is something you are interested in.

The bad is that you need the right of personality to fit in. The docks are generally more rough and tumble then most other departments. The need to be flexible is paramount.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"This may or may not apply , but best advice so far seems to me is to never listen to what other people say without taking it in as a grain of salt. Meaning you are an adult and can make your own observations and perceptions about a person so for someone else to say that someone who will train you is very impatient kind of says a little about what they think of you. 
Do you ask a lot of questions or take longer than others to learn or understand how to so something or have a personality type that brings out impatience in others or do they and thats the reason they say things like that?",0,t3_d9f235,t2_3b5rzkcw,f1hcw92,t3_d9f235,t5_1387r9,1569490724,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"its all relative kid. But yes it does suck. So do most any jobs after a while for various reasons. 
We all end up making the sacrifice of committing 4-16 hours of our time and needs and wants to an employer in order to earn money to have to use to do what we want once in a while on our own time. 
Not every day has sucked but the ones that do really do. 
It took me 2 months to get used to the standing and walking of several miles a shift.  I'm like over twice your age and so it definitely doesnt get any easier as you get older. 

I know water by itself is boring and unappealing but you really need to be drinking more of that instead of with the electrolite syrup stuff. Too much of that and it will cause some issues like muscle cramping and stuff.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The main reason is usually cost and speed. We’re always going to use the cheapest option. Sometimes that’s AMZL  sometimes that is USPS or UPS. It all depends on where it’s going and what it is. Something that is super heavy and bulky is generally cheaper to ship through AMZL than third parties, because we don’t have to pay for any overhead. And as far as speed, AMZL is more geared towards fast deliveries. So if you choose a delivery option that is two weeks out, and an FC has extra capacity and packs it out early, we might use a slower shipping option to save cost. Plus AMZL delivery stations don’t have a huge amount of room to just sideline packages. Granted we do it when we have to, but we try to minimize what we have to so that we can save the valuable space we have.",0,t3_d9hcze,t2_bctgz,f1hmsw3,t3_d9hcze,t5_1387r9,1569496694,URL not found

It really all comes down to who is interviewing, but as long as you reach out to the hiring manager and touch base with them and get to know them, they should let you in on a few things to bone up on.

Though, again, it was my very first Amazon interview and I am very happy that I got through it with an inclination! Just keep at it and make sure you network with everyone around you and those in your own IT department! They are a valuable fountain of resources.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I'd recommend calling ERC, it might be a mistake on  HR they have to fix cause you're new. Usually for meals, it will say MEAL under event.

It seems that it's marking you as clocked in/out early. The system probably assumes you clocked out early at 2:30pm to go home and not for the break.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I worked in retail for nearly three full years. I'll take Amazon any day!

First off, I left making $10.41/hr. Amazon pays $15/hr. That alone is a step up.

However, I did attend college, I graudated... and I hated the jobs I got from that. They were desk jobs that amounted to little more than being a seat warmer for 7 - 9 hours, and I learned very quickly office environments and similar are high school 2.0. One position fired me, not for being incompetent, but because I didn't have a new BFF... within four days of being at the company. Yes, they actually told me *as they were firing me* I was good at the job, but they don't think it'll work out (yes, that was the best excuse they had; I don't think it's coincidence the only other young person there was planning to quit later in the year). Ironically, I've made several friends at Amazon, so the fucking fools were impatient. Not my damn problem. And yes, Amazon pays more than both of those office jobs.

No dealing with customers, actually having work to do (getting paid to do nothing sounds fun until ""nothing"" means ""pretend you're busy for nine hours""), no micromanagement, and while making friends is nice (as I said, I've made several), you're hired to work first and foremost, not hunt out new BFFs. Yes, it has its problems like any job, but so far, Amazon is proving to be best job I've had. Let's see how long I can say that.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I can kind of answer with personal experience with your second question.

Night shift is totally abnormal and I have personally never truly adjusted to the schedule even though I'm a permanent worker and have the same shift as you. Prior to this I worked overnight in a FedEx warehouse. 

The \*vast majority\* of people never quite get ""used"" to night shift. We can only do things that help, like purchasing blackout curtains for the day when we're trying to get our sleep, having a box fan in your room for white noise if you live close to a busy street or neighborhood, and making sure we eat properly before taking on the night. This work is physically demanding so don't be surprised when you spend the entire day knocked out, only to wake up a few hours before your shift starts. During my first weeks, I spent my days off resting - I can't really imagine attending college while doing overnight shifts.

If I had any advice, it'd be to see if you can apply for an in-FC transfer? Explain your situation with college and see if you can have daytime instead.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I’m not a stower but I found these tips from a Facebook group I’m in:

“As soon as you sign into your screen, if you have time organize your sled before pods start arriving to your station. Once you see pods coming in and if they do not turn, scan into your case or tote with an item ready in your hand. Spend as much time on that pod stowing. Bin sweep as in move shit around in bins to where there is room to put items in. Utilize your ladder to go up to the bins and put items there. Don’t just release the pod cause you don’t want to use the ladder. The more time you spend on a pod stowing, the lower your takt time will be and your rate will go up. Don’t focus on the size of the freight you have on the sled, just stow it. You need to have the mindset of everything needs to be stowed. Do not focus on size. Too many people on my shift focuses on the size of the stuff they on their sleds which makes it difficult to achieve their goal—“",0,t3_dbdfsw,t2_3n3c1wlj,f20grka,t3_dbdfsw,t5_1387r9,1569859511,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Currently in stow, using the hands-free scanner (active stow I think it's called?) here's some tips folks gave me that have really helped with my own takt time:

1. If there's any down time, such as when you've signed in and are waiting for pods, get your sled organized. First two slots should be smaller items, second two for medium/larger. The further back your smalls are the longer you have to take to stow them, that half second it takes to turn/step back adds up.

2. Always make sure you're scanned into at least six totes/cases at any given time to reduce pod gaps. I prefer to be scanned into at least seven myself, sometimes eight.

3. Bin sweeps are important! Make sure you're doing them often. Bin sweeping is just moving things around in a bin to better fit more items. Sometimes that extra second taken moving something around can let you stow three or four more items at a much faster rate.

4. Don't release pods early. Try to put as much into a pod as you can without overstuffing the bins. You'll generally find a correlation between your UPF (Units per Face - how many items you stow into each pod) and your Takt Time as you become more experienced. Try to shoot for at least nine items per Pod, medium/large items aside.


Just out of curiosity, what's your Takt Time goal? We're expected to hit a time of no more than 9 secs, but they're trying to shift us towards a 7 sec Takt Time.",0,t3_dbdfsw,t2_kj5oq3q,f20k1tr,t3_dbdfsw,t5_1387r9,1569860585,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"As a former stow ambassador what I can say to help takt coach is generalities, as I have not seen you stow and assuming you work an AR Sortable site. But here is what I coach to most of the times I was coaching, as they were the common errors:

Sled organization: it is more then smalls in front and larges in the back. You want whatever contianer you are working out of to be as close to the pod as possible.  Any time spent walking to and from your container is time not spent stowing. The goal is that you need to walk to and from the back of your sled only twice, once to move the container in back to the front, and once to return it to the back of your sled. Steps are your enemy, take as few as possible 

Work the pod in a pattern. I tend to work from bottom left to upper right. Once you hit a certain part of the pod you automatically know that you are done with the pod and can move on. This prevents time wasted looking at the pod trying to find space.

Work hard to stow items first, every time a pod comes up. I have the hard, annoying, heavy, oversized and just plain awkward items in the very back of my sled, and I always spend a half second looking at each new pod and asking myself ""can I get rid of this?"". Think tetris, you want to get the harder pieces slotted in first and the easy to stow items in last, as they are less demanding.

That's about all I can offer without being there in person. Best of luck to ya",0,t3_dbdfsw,t2_o3j7j,f2255zp,t3_dbdfsw,t5_1387r9,1569882156,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Most sites use an indirect interest form to help select people for indirect roles. If you want to learn indirect you need to talk to HR or your learning team and put in a form for each role you are interested in.

As part of that process your manager has to ""rank"" or score you, and that is a good way to get feedback as to what you are doing well, and what you may need to work on.

If you are talking about cross training into other departments then that is up to your manager and ops.  Some sites offer cross training to struggling new hires to try to find something that they are good at, to avoid having to terminate them for productivity. Some sites do it at LC5 (160 hours in path) and some at LC3 (80 hours in path). It all depends on your leadership",0,t3_db4b1c,t2_o3j7j,f22636z,t3_db4b1c,t5_1387r9,1569882644,URL not found

&gt;1. Can you bring your cell phone into orientation? I know you can't bring it on the work floor. 

1. Yes, you can bring it to orientation only, but you don't want to have it out, or with a ringer on. They will give you instructions on installing an app called amazon a to z. The app is the tool for tracking your time or requesting days off.  They'll go over some of how all that works with you.  Outside of the conversation of the app, don't have it out at all during orientation.  Be sure to ask for a locker at orientation to otherwise store your phone for a normal work-day, since as you said, it won't be allowed on the work floor. 


&gt;2. If you sign up for healthcare on day one do you really have coverage when you leave the building?

2. This answer is specific to being a full-time employee.  Seasonal is a whole different thing that I don't have any information on. The day Amazon considers you ""working"" and getting benefits, would be the next scheduled day after orientation. Lets say orientation is 1pm Wednesday, but the schedule you will be on, is a 6:30pm to 5am shift Friday - Monday, and you did all of the other steps, benefits would start that first Friday you came in to work. 


&gt;3. What type of drinks can you have at your work station on the floor?

Water only.  Flavored water is not allowed at the work station specifically (when I asked that question). There is no ""water police"" and there are many vending machines at the break rooms with other drinks. From Amazon's perspective, drinks other than water can damage products. There are water and ice fountains to refill your water bottle (that you get on day one) in all of the break rooms.  Yes,  you can bring your own water bottles if you want.


  
&gt;4. Is it really stressful to clock in and out on time or is it usually not a problem with waiting in line?

No problems for me. There are many stations to clock in and out in my FC, and I expect many others. Other than being at the station on time, I've had no problems.  Longest I ever had to wait was 15 to 20 seconds when 10ish people were clocking in.

The same for Tier III PAs. They make base+shift differential. Tier III in our FC's base pay is $16.50 an hour.

If you see a position you like, but do not like the hours, I'd still suggest you apply. If you do transfer, you can set up your own schedule as a school accommodation (with school schedule).

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Shift choice is you choose your shift. If you're referring to the application portion, it will have a list of shifts available. Just make sure you're looking at part times locations. 

For a sort center, we chose what shifts worked for us at the new hire event. During peak times, we had to be available up to an hour later. So when I worked 1130 pm to 330am, we had to be available until 430am. And have to available up to 6 days a week. 

If you work for more like a Prime Now location, your orientation and training days are set times, but the shifts you work are not. 

For example, I pick Oct 3rd to 5th and Oct 10th to 12th, 1:30 am to 6am. Those are my set training days and hours. However, I only have to sign up for one 4 1/2 hours shift a month to keep Amazon employment. Every week they send out different shifts and you pick whichever works for you. they can get picked up fast. You can work as many shifts as you like (or able to) or just that one shift a month.

You will be fine. At the sort center I worked at, we had a lot of people aged over 50. It wasn't as physically straining as an fulfillment center.

Once you hit levels, pay fluctuates by department. If your job is more data dev. and decide to go into a general IT position, usually you'll get a pay cut.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"So I’m also in stow, this is what works for me. 
1) Organize your totes smallest to largest, scan at least 6 (7-8 is best, you’ll get more robot bins sent to you this way, the less you have scanned in the less bins you get sent to you and more gaps are likely). 
2) I watch as the bins get close to see the size item I’ll need and I make sure to have the item scanned as the robot approaches and to start fast, I find that the faster I can get to 9-10 seconds (sometimes 8) and if I can maintain it for 15/30 minutes then it becomes easier the rest of the time to keep the time low and the tak time rises slower. 
3) When encountering large pieces, and if I have a low tak time, I’ll devote my efforts to clearing those big pieces out, the faster I can clear them the higher the chances are of getting smaller pieces. (Smaller pieces have a lower tak time (5-10secs) while larger items can take 12-17 secs to stow)
4) Keep a few small items on hand in case you get too many big pieces in a row and so you can lower the tak time during those times. Tak time for some reason rises faster than you’re able to lower it.",0,t3_dbdfsw,t2_gpf8h,f291b87,t3_dbdfsw,t5_1387r9,1570076939,URL not found

I have been lucky enough to find a 1:1 ratio for extra days worked and sometimes better than that. Ex. Working 6 hours in an extra day and getting a full day off in the bank.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. All your experience can be learned on the job. For external L6/7/8 your experience will need to be rigorous examples of your ability to improve processes, manage teams of managers and safety improvements/standards you have created that were successful. The most common way to promote to L8 internally is by being successful in at a minimum IB/OB/ICQA. You will need data points to back up your success. In addition, you will need to be supported by 2 different current L8 managers and several L7s. They will all need to write promotion documents detailing their support. 

Generally, you will spend 2 years at each level. You can move up faster with the right experience/support. 

2. Once you are hired, you can transfer to almost any role. All you need to do is have the ability to lead. However for technical roles, you will be interviewed and given test to prove your knowledge. Similar goes for certain safety roles. 

3. There was not a pay bump for a corporate role, as your business title will remain the same. You could negotiate more pay but it will be unrelatedly to the fact that you are taking a role in corporate.",0,t1_f2i3tp3,t2_4k7ihdqs,f2i6px0,t3_ddiqxw,t5_1387r9,1570252973,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"L5 to L6 simply needs a promotion document and support from other L6s, HR manager and your GM. Make sure you are having monthly 1:1s with your direct manager, ask where you stand in terms or performance (Top tier, Effective or least effective) and make sure each 1:1 is well documented. You should have 2 talking points prepared for your 1:1 meetings:

1:  A Long term project you are working on and data to support how well it’s going. 

2: 1-2 small projects and data to support how well they are going. Small projects typically consist of improvements that generally take 1 - 2 weeks to identify, improve and show success. Think implementing a small but impactful change that results in 5% improvement to rate, quality or the number of safety incidents . 

A few months before each quarter, promotion documents are written and sent up the chain for approval. Make sure to ask you manager each 1:1 which quarter you are slated for promotion. You should also prepare your own promotion document ( Detailed list of what processes you have improved in the last 3 months, be detailed in data showing the before and after metrics). 

Not that you need to impress but you will need L6s to speak on your behalf when promotions are reviewed so make sure you are working with L6s and offering to take on small projects so they have some positive input during promotion review meetings. You don’t want to be the person that works hard but no one can speak to that hard work. 

Overall, push your manager to track your improvement and success when looking at perform vs your peers ( department rate, quality, attrition etc). Always ask where you stand and what your promotion slate looks like. The most common reasons L5s are looked over for promotion is their manager has not documented success stories due to poor quality or non existent 1:1s and they are not holding their direct managers accountable for their development. If your manager is documenting your performance, that information will be passed up to the sr. team and HR management when they do reviews of manager performance.  L6s are busy and while in a perfect world they are focused on your development and promotion, this does not always happen. So don’t let your manager skip a 1:1, make sure they are documenting your performance and always ask/document your performance in terms of metrics. Ask your direct manager if you can take some task of their plate so you can demonstrate that you can perform at the L6 level.",0,t1_f2iiu60,t2_4k7ihdqs,f2imtzr,t3_ddiqxw,t5_1387r9,1570259493,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I currently work as a field transportation lead on TOM in an AR FC. Even though I work closely with dock leadership on a daily basis, I feel that TOM is ostracized from the FC. Our team is excluded from every team building initiative due to the nature of our responsibilities (we cannot leave our positions unattended for any amount of time, etc.) and our work is most often outside of the building. While I understand that TOM is a support team and the idea that ""the FC is our customer"", I don't understand the barrier between TOM and operations aside from a literal concrete wall. We would like to be part of your associate engagement events like company picnics, holiday raffles and peak incentives, and we could potentially benefit from gemba meetings and  regular contact with people in your position. It was a multiple week battle for our leadership team just to get our associates invited to birthday roundtables to offer feedback about the facility they work at every day. My first thought was to go to my trans AM but after having this discussion they made it clear that they see no issue with the way things are.  
With all that said and your experience working in multiple roles and departments, here are my questions:  
1. What party in my FC would be the most appropriate to raise this concern with?  
2. How would you recommend I start that conversation?

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Why can't I even make the safety team or even Ambassador? Ive trained newbies many a times and help out. As for the safety team I don't understand what happened since I wrote my name on any and every sign up sheet for every shift in order to be sure I didn't miss the correct one this time around. 
I do care. Is this maybe the problem? 
Or could it be stemming from another associate who had trained me and I thought we clicked being sort of alike and musicians and all but long story short I must have been delusional and she said I scared her and that's why she is avoiding me etc etc. Im not a creepy stalker ( plus we are both women) and I'm not sure if she ever said anything to hr.  However I did have a VM and missed call around that same time come to find out it was from the HR person at the time but she never once said or mentioned Amazon in the message she said something like Senior HR for San Diego County - which led me to think the County was at it again for recruiting poll workers for the next election and I need a break this time so I was avoiding them. 

After meeting her face to face I put 2 and 2 together and explained this and then I asked her what she wanted to ask me back in January. Then she just asked a strange question one much like the survey questions we get on the devices we sign into.  Very odd. I let it go.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. Go directly to your GM. Come prepared with strong data to support your request. GEMBA is critical for all management to speak directly to their associates while the sr team is there to hold them accountable. That should be an easy win. 

While it’s not exactly written down, production and building plans are all dependent on IB and OB. So unfortunately the focus drifts to support them, they are the stars of the show. This means it’s easy to loose sight of how critical support teams (TOM, ICQA, Safety, others) are. Like I said, the ability to run support teams and how often is dependent on IB/OB hours, if OB has 50% of its team show up, we are going to reduce support hours by 50%.

2. Use the VOA board in a respectful way. After you state your issue, request that a Sr. Manager come speak with you.  Share you concerns but be detailed. Don’t give up, it’s reasonable to TOM to be included in everything. Unfortunately some managers don’t speak up for their team. Accountability is the best way to get something done, keep respectfully asking for a follow up and details to support their decision. 

3. Yes. But your voice needs to be heard. Often, concerns like this don’t ever make it up the chain to the GM. But this is definitely something where one word from me and everyone on my team would make it happen. It’s not a crazy idea and is easily fixable.",0,t1_f2kdz8r,t2_4k7ihdqs,f2l7eds,t3_ddiqxw,t5_1387r9,1570292620,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"This is pretty cool. Usually I only see L4/5s doing AMAs. How do you view the work life balance for managers? It was often talked about in my facility that the associate experience is very important. What about the manager experience? I worked in 2 different buildings and the work/life balance was not great. I know other buildings can be different but the 2 I experienced were very intense. Do you think Amazon will ever turn around the requirements for management? I was the leading shift in OB (L4 AFE AM) and my team was still required to work 13 hour days and bumped up to around 16 hour days 6 days a week during peak. Also, who dictates these work hours? I am not really complaining. I very much enjoyed and appreciated my time at Amazon. I ultimately had to leave due to relocation with no Amazon buildings nearby (weird, I know).

comment,AmazonFC,2,"Work life balance is often horrible, but it does not need to be. Performance is the best way to improve work/life balance. Come early, prepare, perform, track what you are missing in real time, recap and leave. Also it’s up to the Ops/Sr to step up and kick managers out. I made it a habit to start asking what my managers are still doing here 30 min after shift. A good ops will listen and work towards removing that barrier. 

Hours are determined at the sight level, often performance driven. Managers should be aware of how their shift performed and use that to go home on time. If your shift performed well, there is no need to stay late. If you missed, it make sense to stay late. However, you should be investing that extra time to find a solution so you don’t have to keep staying late.

Things are going to change. As a network, we realize that end of shift washes are a large driver for managers staying late. We are automating washes away. The misses/success will be instantly identified and bridge formats will be standardized. 

Manager hours are starting to be tracked at a regional level and buildings that pass a threshold receive regional pressure to start bridging why. Work/life is one of the top manager concerns and it’s starting to be noticed.

As for the manager experience, we need to improve. This is largely driven at the site level and it’s easy to forget management.",0,t1_f2lb3ci,t2_4k7ihdqs,f2lf3y2,t3_ddiqxw,t5_1387r9,1570294343,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Well you need to be fully trained and off your learning curve in at least 1 major process (pick, pack, stow, etc). After that it really depends on your FC. Some will take applications, some just pick people they think are good. Imo it's best to be cross trained in a number of things because you will understand everything much better.

For me personally OB wouldn't give me PS because I was a highly used ambassador. I didn't want to give up ambassador so I switched to ICQA. ICQA is different because we are allowed more PS per capita, as we PS the whole building and not just our own department. And the process to become an ICQA PS is actually clear, unlike OB who would pick people at random. (like I said it really varies by building) 

So I communicated with the manager I wanted to be PS and he made sure I worked my way up and got it. But my story is going to be very different from yours, so I would start asking your PS and PA's on the process at your FC.",0,t1_f2u8wfj,t2_fe0ni,f2u9p42,t3_ddisua,t5_1387r9,1570410954,URL not found

He's also getting frustrated because he filled in for the PA for three months then applied for the position just for them to hire from outside the company. They hired a young college student who now has all her friends working there, trying to train them to do problem solve, IOL, etc and push out the people who have been there for years. They start the night doing problem solve, can't keep up, so they get my husband to come over and ""help"", then they leave to go get breakfast together while he's stuck an extra hour to hour and a half beyond the required overtime fixing and finishing their work while he got stuck stowing all night up until then. I don't know if this is common everywhere, maybe he should look to move to a different location and stay with Amazon, or is this happening everywhere?",0,t3_df14ri,t2_3zdeimpt,f30ouua,t3_df14ri,t5_1387r9,1570559139,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I know it sucks but such is life at Amazon. Everybody and their mother are ordering things for Christmas and they need all the people they can get. This is why you’ll see a massive increase in the amount of VET offered and an increase in work hours and MET. 

Amazon considers itself to be your first job and primary employer. This is part of the deal you accept when you get hired. Exceptions might be made but I highly doubt it and if so, it will probably be a one time deal. We are entering peak season and an increase in work hours is normal for this type of industry.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Guess it depends on the site. I didn't mind stowing at first, but it ended up becoming torture because of a select few other workers. Some people will end up with a really high stow rate ONLY because they go from aisle to aisle and work ONLY jiffy's because its faster, and they can get more done in a shorter period of time. Due to that, they leave a mess of backed up boxes for someone else to take care of. They also leave the bags a mess when they just throw the jiffy's inside without a care to the point that they fall out. And since they are focusing only on jiffy's, they won't setup a new bag when one is full. This causes the next person to end up with a low stow rate since they have to clean up after the jiffy jerk.  


Personally, I ended up moving to inbound and work on the dock. I'm usually a waterspider, but I do just about anything that needs doing on the dock.",0,t1_f2q5mdi,t2_17j9e4p8,f30zvci,t3_ddisua,t5_1387r9,1570565439,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"That's what he deals with daily as well...day shift leaves the problem solve area absolutely destroyed, he actually showed me a message from his Chime that he sent to the day and night shift managers... He regularly has to do six to ten cages that day shift left sitting, as well as clean up trash, etc, as well as keep up with what is being dropped off to him by people on his shift. He is known for being the fastest and most accurate, so anytime someone else starts the night doing problem solve, then realizes how much work is actually involved, he gets pulled away from whatever he was doing to ""help"" them ""catch up"", only for them to walk out the door right on time while he spends another hour or longer finishing their work and making sure nothing is left for day shift. If they would just put him in problem solve every day from the start, he would catch up and stay caught up and be able to leave on time, but instead they wait until it is so out of control that he has to spend hours fixing everything. I told him from now on, if he isn't assigned to problem solve at the start of the day, just take off some personal time and come home early once or twice so the manager is forced to be the one to stay so they can see what he's dealing with. I think it will only take one or two times before they quit letting every new hire that thinks problem solve looks easy just jump in, especially during peak. So much about that place just doesn't make sense to me and I see why they have such a rapid turnover rate.",0,t1_f314x6l,t2_3zdeimpt,f319u2s,t3_df14ri,t5_1387r9,1570570750,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I applied for the T1 Equipment Coordinator Position. Tier 1 but it gets your foot into the door to build a career with the IT Department. I have No certifications but I have a strong technical background as all I do is fiddle with electronics. I’ve diagnosed and repaired PCs remotely, updated and formatted them remotely, bought, repaired and flipped old functional computers, and rebuilt an iPhone 6 down to its logic board. As long as you have a little Tech background (they’ll teach you as they want you to do everything their way) and possess leadership capacity as shown in STAR format it’s possible. Just gotta stand out. Some attributes to focus on are “Ownership, Customer Obsession, Have a backbone, Are Right A Lot, and Frugality”. Don’t mind what peers care or say of you, just focus on your career. If you can show that you’re focused, willing to help others(customer obsession), and maintain a positive attitude you’ll be able to accomplish a lot.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"They aren't making him stay late in the sense of saying that he can't leave, but it's understood that if he wants to be allowed to continue doing problem solve or problem solve for the people doing pass through, that he will just do it. The new operations manager came at the same time as the new PA, she went to the same school and is part of that little group of new people that go to breakfast every day after work and walk around talking crap about one another at work, then hang out other times. He says the whole thing is really childish, but they're basically trying to push out the people who have been there for years. He's hoping to just hang in there long enough to apply for a PA position, even if he has to get one at a different location here in Columbus or work a different shift. They are yet to hire a PA who has been working there though, they keep hiring outside applicants who have zero background working for Amazon.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"At my station, we are slowly going up to the goal of 400. Right now, the weeks leading up to our longer days, our target goal is 300. When I stow, my days generally go like this:

1. Try to have a scanner logged on and ready to go by the time stand up is over
2. When I get to my isles (generally am assigned 3 full isles), I ""create"" all of the bags first before I stow anything
3. I aim for the jiffy's and make sure I have at least 3-5 in my hand whenever I grab some out of a tote
4. When stowing oversized boxes, I try to stack 2-3 on the floor and slide them back all at the same time

Another thing to mention is that if I ever help someone with their isles (either get moved by an ambassador/PA or on my own accord), I never do the entirety of the 3 shelves. I almost always do 2 shelves (the middle and the top or the middle and the bottom) and I generally aim for totes, too. Lately, with all of these in mind, my rate has been going up and I'm generally able to keep a stow rate of around an average of 300 for the whole day (8 hour shift). 

Last weekend, I tried to go all out and stow as fast as I could (though I had a shortage of totes in my isles) and within the first quarter of the shift, I stowed a 427, but by the end of the shift my average for the day was a 324. I don't think a 400 stow rate is possible without a lot of totes.

I don't think tasking out stops the clock, it just adds to your ""time off task"" which is not something you want to be seen having much of, aside from bathroom or water breaks. You shouldn't task out when doing anything unless you are going on your break (15 minutes) or bathroom/water breaks - you should log out completely for your lunch (30 minutes), since when you change bags or have to move something to problem solve, you're still technically ""on task,"" you just have to be as quick as you can about it.",0,t1_f3935xd,t2_o9v3g,f3l2yty,t3_ddz6lq,t5_1387r9,1570972026,URL not found

At my location, there is a conveyor belt  that brings the boxes down, we have pullers that take the boxes and packages off the belt and place them on bakers rack at the beginning of my row, I may have row 1,2 and 3,4

so that would be two columns, inside my row I would have collum A B C D E G,

It seems like that would take a long time picking the boxes at the rack to a certain bag to scan there.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"As I said, Amazon pays more than both of those jobs, so it's not a decision I regret, especially since both bored the living hell out of me anyway and one proved to be the adult rendition of high school. ""Anyone can do"" retail too, yet I fucking can't stand it.

I don't really care about being at the bottom level. It's more satisfying than the other jobs because I don't have to pretend to be busy for almost nine hours. I actually am busy (and I work for six unless I choose otherwise; I hate long hours). School isn't going anywhere, and neither is my ""degree"" that proved to be more of a waste (I really don't give a shit about it at this point) of my time and money. If I'd known high school clique and seat warming jobs were all I'd get from it, I never would've pursued it. I didn't voluntarily leave. *I got fired*, one of which, as I said, was for not having a new BFF within four days. But that's a much better environment... /s

Obviously, some people enjoy office jobs and that's cool. To each, their own. I, however, do not. I don't like pretending to be busy and I'd rather my job not depend on how fast I make friends (ironically, I have made friends at Amazon).

I haven't even hit ninety days at Amazon (79 days), so I'm not comfortable applying for something higher yet. I'd rather stick around for at least a year before I do. I'm also not a fan of management in any industry (management positions have too much stress and too many restrictions), so even if I wanted a higher position, that'd be out.",0,t1_f3lu3c9,t2_pc76k,f3ndscz,t3_d8mgy4,t5_1387r9,1570997220,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Let me say it this way: when people need accommodation for an injury, they usually get put in pack singles.

Pack singles is usually the least physically demanding of all departments in an AR Sortable FC. You will be standing at a station similar to stow but will be using your hands and your wrists extensively. Pack singles demands a fair amount of dexterity to perform well, instead of the upper body strength and endurance needed for pick.

There is usually more socialization in pack singles as stations are small and crowded together. That can be a good or a bad thing. If you are used to manual or ARSAW stations a pack singles station is cramped as all get out.

Ultimately it all depends on what you want to do. Do you want an ""easier"" job among strangers or do you want a ""tougher"" job among people you know? It's all up to you.",0,t3_dgoo19,t2_o3j7j,f3o22my,t3_dgoo19,t5_1387r9,1571006469,URL not found

The only struggle in my life right now is the pain I have from getting my wisdom teeth extracted. Please take your condescending bullshit attitude and fake concern somewhere else.

If you are worried about negative effects then just give your leadership some heads up before you use it. Since you are not in any critical roles then there is no problem.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Seeing as I missed the last post, i'm going to address something here from your previous posting.

&gt;What do you guys want at the FC? It can be anything... napping areas, playing room, closer restrooms,having amazonFresh free benefits at the workspace.

Firstly, I side more with Amazon on many issues, but in some instances there are cases where Amazon is in the wrong. The things that people go on strike for and the demands that are coupled with that are often infantile and ignorant of the reality of their situation. Are 'napping areas' appropriate for a warehouse setting? Not really, if you want to nap, work in a corporate office. Is a 'play-room' justifiable and necessary? Are bathrooms really *that* far? And offering certain perks for free to 600,000+ employees, is that something we can spend money on?

I understand many individual's grievances with Amazon, I have several of my own, however, these attacks are often misguided; their energy would be better spent targeting the areas of Amazon that are severely lacking, and that actually cause the problems that you see at the associate level. Leadership at the Amazon FC in many cases is horrendously poor. I have never, and will never agree with their policy to hire people who have zero work experience, but a Bachelors or Masters. I know several individuals who had absolutely zero work or life experience, and were dropped into an L6 OM role simply because they have a masters. These people do not possess leadership qualities and they cannot relate to people who did waste 7+ years of their life on a worthless economics degree. 

The unintended stress of the job is not due to a lack of free Fresh, play rooms, or napping rooms; these are symptoms of poor leadership that should be doing their job- leading and ensuring that everyone can hit their numbers without mindlessly stressing. There are several instances I can recall from memory where Senior Ops have turned a blind eye to the problems in their buildings which cause undue stress on their associates which ultimately put them in compromising situations, or in situations which may even lead to a termination that was entirely unavoidable. As a butchered example; if Ops has turned a blind eye to their bin etiquette and it takes a single associate more than even a minute to find their item due to capacity issues, and you then continually pass down verbal/written warnings to top performers despite those issues, you are an abhorrent ""leader"" with no genuine understanding as to why your building is in such disarray. 


This isn't to say that all people coming from that sector to fill Operations roles are alike, but by and large these are the type that you would see come and go in the FC. 

What would I want at the FC? A better hiring method. The interview process is standardized, but entirely flawed in the sense that it is tailored to those who can easily falsify a story, steal another's story, or be favored internally by someone who vouches for the undeserving (then again that's something you'll find anywhere). There are aspects of the interview (such as roleplay) that are downplayed to the point of irrelevance so long as you're all about ""the data,"" because Amazon is such a ""data driven"" company. Yeah, I say this mockingly, because the human aspect of FC functionality is often overlooked in certain ways. I would much rather want a manager that has above average people skills and inherent leadership skills than a bookworm who knows his numbers; you can teach someone how to read a stupid graph and use a calculator to balance your workforce, you can't teach someone qualities that are a result of character and understanding.


 &gt; How do you imagine your perfect day? (you might or might not include work on it)

Less messes made by children and plants that aren't dying/dead that need to be babysat.

&gt;How do you imagine your perfect day at work?

Less transfers, less traffic.

&gt;Is your current job your dream job?

Not really; couple shit pay with shit coworkers and a generally boring environment and you have... a boring job.

&gt;If not, what would it make it better?

Job environment is something that couldn't exactly be fixed by putting up some artwork or anything. I genuinely believe some jobs will always be viewed by the majority as stepping stones to other positions within Amazon. If you happen to find yourself in these jobs, it most likely will be an uphill battle due to your predecessors not wanting to do their job, and you having to pick up their slack.

&gt;What's what you value the most in the workplace?

Work relationships and general work knowledge that can be applied to other departments once you leave. The cliche ""it's not what you know, but who you know"" will always be true. Finding the right people to associate yourself with will prove to be the greatest weapon in your war chest, especially those who you know will go far in life, and will easily vouch on your behalf when you are looking elsewhere for a job or leg up in the world. There's nothing morally wrong with this dynamic to friendships as long as you and said friend are of good moral character, but of course you have those that have always progressed by nefarious means and will take like-minded people with them. Aside from that, what's most important in the workplace is gaining knowledge; not just a basic understanding of your job, but a better understanding of your position than everyone else. In you're FC problem-solve, you should essentially be the SME (subject matter expert) for the tools that you utilize in problem-solve; you should be spending your downtime looking into Wiki pages about the different tools and the back-end logic (in terms of how the tools 'think'/operate). The more knowledge you obtain, the better you are able to execute your job.

&gt;What do you enjoy the most during your work breaks?

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. My perfect day consists of me spending time with friends or family. I enjoy visiting theme parks close to home. Just having fun and treating myself to something nice after a long work week.

3. I’m not too sure what I’d consider my “dream job” but I’m pretty happy with what I do now. It’s hard to find a job nowadays but I’m grateful I have a job that I enjoy.  

What could make this job better would be more opportunities to get cross trained in other departments — learning more of the process. Rewarding the hardworking associates. 

4. What I value most in the workplace is building a relationship with my coworkers. I spend  40 hours with them each week and the whole team aspect is what I enjoy. We are all there with one goal, and how we work as a team to accomplish it is so rewarding.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I can tell you with absolute certainty that at the very least in NA, between the US and Canada, Amazon does allow internal transfers/promotions between the two countries and the Company will sponsor you for residency/work permit/green card - basically, whatever either country required for you to be legally allowed to live and work there. And unless you have a criminal record, they generally always make it happen if they approve the transfer/promotion.

I did an inter-country transfer when I applied for OM so I’m familiar with the process. If you do a lateral transfer note however that they’ll adjust your salary based on local norms, so don’t always expect the same income. Also, they pay you in the local currency, not that of your home country.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"No. It’s a lengthy process and generally you know you have the job approved long before you actually start. Amazon must sponsor you for immigration purposes to get required status (work permit/residency/green card/etc) so that you can legally live and work in that country. Amazon corporate lawyers handle most of the heavy lifting but the process can only go as fast as the local immigration system allows. You just need to make sure whatever they send you for signing, etc is submitted on time and they’ll make it happen as soon as they are able. It can take some time depending on which country you’re transferring to.

They also do not sponsor hourly associates for these types of transfers, only management +.

You mentioned that both OMs and the SOM have a good relationship with you. There’s a reason for that. As an OM who was in OB, I can tell you hands down that top tier pickers stand out from the pack hella more than a top tier packer. Again, doesn’t necessarily matter but it depends on what your goals are. If it’s career advancement, you *want* to stand out and be noticed. Far easier to do that as a picker.

It is far more physically demanding, but it’d also more rewarding - again, depending on what your longer term goals are.

You also don’t need to work at all that day as jury duty legally excused you from *working that day* - period. You can if you want, but legally you’re excused and Amazon still must pay you for your originally scheduled shift. You are not expected to do just duty and work the same day simply because it fell outside your working hours. If you’re scheduled to work the same day, that shift is excused no matter the timing.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Don’t use AtoZ - you’ll end up using PTO/VAC/UPT. Amazon is legally required to pay for lost time due to jury duty at their expense, not the employee’s, and HR has a special pay code for jury duty time off.

See HR and it’ll be excused and cover. FYI, don’t need to go to work at all on a day scheduled for jury duty, even if working hours are scheduled outside of jury duty timing. The entire day is legally excused.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Thanks for your insight. I'm not sure that what path I stay in as a Tier 1 Associate is going to matter that much towards career progression, because I'm a handful of courses away from a bachelors degree.   


I'm actually worried about standing out too much. TL;DR HR screwed up pretty bad and after doing what my flair says, I've been given a couple of rather unique accommodations to the Amazon workplace. The head of Site HR periodically emails me to see if things are cool now, lol. One of my OMs and my AM actually was with me during one of the times when HR messed up. They didn't want me gone as they know not only do I make rate, but I pick up the slack for others. Still though, I've had issues with some power tripping PAs.   


Your analysis of top pickers standing out makes a lot of sense. Our head of Site HR told me that my numbers usually take about a year or so for people to pull and I kept up this pace since my second week. When I did have to escalate my issues per my flair, I do think that my documented positives for quality helped me establish some degree of credibility. Considering my accommodations and the fact that I exceed far beyond what is expected in my current role does make me think sticking with the team that ""knows"" me in that regard might make the most sense. Constantly being assigned to  ARSAW 3112 that is literally in direct line of sight of manager's station makes me think I'm standing out too much. If I hear another PA/AM/OM say that the system is random/automatic/whatever I'm just going to cry, because even if it is purely algorithmic, then why me to that particular station all the time?   


 Again thank you. It looks like I'll commit myself to going through Peak 2019 as a picker still. Perhaps it could make a difference in where I land after I finish my degree should I stick with Amazon. Worst case scenario in an economic downturn I'll have more job stability compared to those who fret about being bottom 5%, or work in a shopping mall.",0,t1_f3tixm8,t2_4noia19,f3ul468,t3_dgoo19,t5_1387r9,1571162603,URL not found

Amazon teaches depth, specifically in areas which amazon finds useful for you to know.

Batchlor degrees are about breadth of knowledge. Yes, you focus in one area... but you also spend 2 years worth of credits on non-major related knowledge incorporating history, language, literature, art etc. Amazon does not find it useful for you to to have an appreciation of Shakespeare, or knowledge of pre-industrial European history, so Amazon does not teach you those things.

My thesis proposal might seem stupid (when I share it with everyone) for you and kinda ""superficial"", but it goes more in the psycological &amp; community improvement. 

So, above all, what called my attention is that you said you have ""shit coworkers"" but do you think this is a general feeling among the FC or is just you? cause when you read other opinions, coworkers are the thing that keeps the mood up for most of others.",0,t1_f3ppw5r,t2_t60fc,f40g0vc,t3_dhqcf8,t5_1387r9,1571297373,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The job is different based on the type of warehouse you work at. The pay is the same as a tier 3 position inside the building, which also varies based on where you're at. If it's an FC most of your time will be spent in the guard shack checking drivers in and out of the yard while maintaining virtual accuracy for your yard. In addition to this you will be required to learn to operate a terminal tractor to move 53' trailers to and from the dock doors for inbound, outbound and non-inventory teams to utilize. If you don't like working outside, this job is not for you. If those things sound like an interesting challenge that you can commit to it (because TOM team has an abnormally high learning curve) then go for it.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Correct if I’m wrong anyone, but I believe outbound pack flow is the people on pack side who pack the customers orders. They are the ones who pack multis which is more than one item in a package. Different than the process path Outbound Pack Singles.

Outbound Sort Flow is the AA’s(associates) behind the walls that put the item in the wall, rebinners, as they call them. Behind the rebinners is the inducters who place the item from a tote into a tray which then makes it way to the rebinner and the rebinner now grabs the item and places it into the wall until an order is completed. Once the customer order is completed, they push it further down the cubicle that it is placed into and the packer places it into a box and sends it down the conveyor line. 

Outbound Pack Flow is definitely easier on a persons body rather than Outbound Sort Flow. Sort requires a lot of physical movement that really makes an impact.",0,t3_dk9w7o,t2_l6lby,f4ecob0,t3_dk9w7o,t5_1387r9,1571555806,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I’ve been doing a lot of random tasks in ICQA since they’ve hired too many people and expect people to quit when peak starts. I’ve done trash running, shipping, and water spidering really any place they feel like putting me that day to not VTO.

At my location, our ICQA starts at 7:30 and there a 3 jobs I know of in the department; simple bin count (SBC), Cycle Count ( Cc) and SRC, which is the only count I don’t know or even know what the acronym means. All are on universal stations. You’re checking for damage on each of these jobs as well and put stickers on those items and put it in your scanner.

Simple Bin Count (SBC) - when the bins come to you, you scan the bin then you count how many items are in the bin and put that in the scanner. That’s it, it’s really boring though. This is what you’d likely start out on

Cycle Count (CC) - What I’m currently doing. I take all the items out of the bin and doing a “six sided check” to make sure the item is as it says in the scanner and is not damaged. This can be as specific as it having the right amount of a certain quantity in the product. I like CC way better then SBC, but they are still both very boring.

I hope this clears it up a bit for you, I wrote this pretty quickly during break, so if I can clear anything up farther, let me know!",0,t1_f4ebkr1,t2_f32i5nm,f4gosr0,t3_dk9w7o,t5_1387r9,1571583062,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Unfortunately, I can't help you there-- I can only speak to my experience at Delivery stations, where there is typically at most 1 Area Manager running the entire shift.

Delivery stations are smaller operations than the FC though (one FC services many Delivery Stations) and we have discrete phases during a 24-hour period as opposed to discrete areas that continuously operate more or less the same way throughout the day.

My guess given the comparative size of your operation that at least you'll not be the only Area Manager on your shift.",0,t1_f4j5v9s,t2_2k7n57sv,f4j77bp,t3_dkb7lh,t5_1387r9,1571614182,URL not found

Sometimes I think they do dish out punishments according to exact standards so they don’t get punished themselves.

Get to work 1.5 hours before the shift starts for daily meetings and to plan the shift out/check the handoff.  
Once the shift gets going it’s barrier removal/engagement/adjusting the staffing to adjust to performance or changing demands.  

There are injuries/paperwork/ vacation requests/ training seminars you need to lead/ meetings/ doing the task yourself/ as well as a million other things that you’re always doing.

I did the overnight shift but it was only 8 hours. Out of the 3 months I did it, they never made us stay pass our time to leave. They would go around and ask if you could stay for a bit to finish sorting but that wasn’t mandatory and they would understand if you didn’t want to stay.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Nights learning trainer here at an AR sortable FC.

First and formost bring the right attitude. Senior OPs for nights mostly doesn't exist and Ops are notably light on night shift. HR doesn't work the full night most buildings. In my FC nights has 4/5 the tier 1s as days and just under half the support hours. Nights is, somewhat by design, the tail being wagged by the dog, not a full and equal partner of day shift.

*YOU* are going to be Amazon Management in its entirety to your associates by and large. Having not just a good attitude, but a can do attitude is crucial.

If *YOU* cannot help your associates, there will be significant delay in resolving their problems. You need to have the attitude that these are your guys, and while on the floor you need to take care of them.

Most new area managers fail because of time management skills. Being an AM requires you to keep a large number of balls in the air at the same time. You will need to budget your time and move between separate projects seamlessly. Do not over commit to one thing and lose traction on the other 5 deliverables you have that shift.

1: Never negotiate with your team's safety.

2: Don't be afraid to make decisions even if you're not sure if its right or not. Especially being on nights you most likely won't have too much hand holding so have bias for action and make choices quickly. 

3: You'll have a long list of things on your to do list and not enough time to complete them all make sure you prioritize what you spend time on. Keep in mind that sometimes an hour spent today saves 10 hours the next week don't be afraid to make time investments that will help in the future.

4: Understand the why behind what you're doing and explain the why to your team. For example if someone is picking cubiscan and has no idea what cubiscan is they'll have a much worse experience then someone who knows how that helps the customer.",0,t1_f4jgsqf,t2_7gorr,f4nz7cv,t3_dkb7lh,t5_1387r9,1571694530,URL not found

The robots can be individually controlled by every person that has those kindles and at any point we can claim ownership of a robot and turn it on even if it looks like it's not doing anything. It took a whole week of training just to teach us how to safely use the program and Amazon just wants to make sure no one interacts with something if they weren't trained how to interact  with it.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"So more of an update.  I just recently discovered we don’t get shift differential either.  I could have sworn we were told we did at orientation but I went through my paperwork and I don’t see anything about it.  
Also, I guess they’re going from UPT to points for us.  I had just got more UPT on October 1st and used it, then it disappeared.  I got an email saying I now have 7 points and ordinarily they would terminate me but since they are just now transitioning to the new system they will let me stay but if I get another point I will be let go.  Mind you, I got the email at the same time as I used what I thought was UPT so technically I now have 10 points. I check every day to see if I’m on the schedule and so far so good. None of my points or UPT is on the website.  Just all my absences.  Oh, and one other thing. The last 2 days I missed I brought a doctors note but they said Flex can’t get their points/upt excused with doctors notes.

Unfortunately, they do control the yard. If it is impeding on your ability to do your job you need to escalate it now. Talk to your AM, talk to OPs, VOA board. Something to get it out there and known before it hurts you.",0,t3_dln0kh,t2_11jv66,f4sj07x,t3_dln0kh,t5_1387r9,1571778023,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Where to start: Half of the PA's skirted safety rules. One of whom got fired for going into the yard without a spotter just a few weeks earlier. If the associates made the call on who the PA's were, then there would have likely been better ones than what we had! 

Secondly, I admit to screwing up. Are you going to pretend like you haven't made a mistake in your life?

I am simply asking a question. either you have the answer or you don't...

comment,AmazonFC,2,"Figure out why there is a blanket ban. Talk with the TOM lead on your shift, talk with the TAM, see what's going on and how it can be worked around. Communication is key.

Calling it a power trip isn't helpful. Usually issues like this arise when there is a problem with one of the dock departments, which causes a blanket ban across the whole yard. TOM has to be safe, and if one department, on one shift, is creating an unsafe environment, there will sometimes be a knee jerk reaction to it affecting all shifts and all departments. As you said, you're an expert at setting your trailers up, but I guarantee, someone else on a different shift or in a different department, screwed something up, one too many times.

Figure out what happened, figure out why, and get an exception for your team. You just have to talk to the TOM lead and maybe the TAM.",0,t3_dln0kh,t2_sv26c,f4tb1dj,t3_dln0kh,t5_1387r9,1571786179,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1) get good insoles. My personal reccomendation is super feet, ironically found on amazon

2) try and go to bed the same time every day. It will help your body form a routine and offer delicious melatonin at the same time, allowing you better sleep. Also can try a sleep mask. I'm on nights and a mask let's me sleep like a baby. 

3) make meals at home and bring enough for work, or pack a good lunch, or meal prep just for lunches. Snacks is why you are tired. You need to eat protein and fat.

These 3 things will save your life lol

comment,AmazonFC,1,"&gt;I’d probably like sitting behind a desk more

Not to knock you down, but I want to say unless you're a more sedentary person, you're extremely talkative, or you have worse problems than uncomfortable shoes, you'd probably hate desk work.

Retail was my very first job, and I yearned to have a desk job. When I finally did, I hated it! I had two different desk jobs and work was probably less than 20% of most days. 5 days a week, 7 to 9 hours a day, and most of the time spent talking because there was genuinely no work to do. That doesn't sound like a bad thing... until the job proves to be boring as all hell because they want you to pretend you're busy, and faking is not your forte.

I can make friends just fine, but these were jobs that claimed to require a degree, certification, or some kind of schooling when they could easily be done by a 12-year-old child with average eye-hand coordination and reading comprehension. No, I'm not exaggerating. Amazon is actually more of a challenge than these jobs were. This was so bad at the second job, they'd actually fire you if you didn't have a new work best friend within a week. Let me rephrase that: Actual work is so inactive, you get fired, not for poor performance (they actually made a point to say that mine was great), but *for not being extroverted enough* to have the whole office as your new best buds within under a week. That's not a job. That's high school 2.0. Made it no shock to me why the only other person there who was my age intended to leave soon.

I still would prefer a desk job, but if it must come down to choosing between real work and pretending for 7 hours I have work, I'll take the latter. I'd be busy, not fake it.

If you ever do get a desk job, I wish you better luck than me.",0,t1_f4wc5bi,t2_pc76k,f4z83ob,t3_dm1rzf,t5_1387r9,1571898930,URL not found

It’s a good program on paper on your resume and all, and is not unenjoyable for you to do, but I’ll tell you right now from experience Operations literally is not allowed to put you in a critical role (which are key to advancement) if you are an Ambassador. I have wanted to pull some of my associates who were Ambs out of the program to put in a PG role to train to be a PA and Learning put up a massive fight. They budget hours months in advance so your SOL. It can really delay advancement especially to a PA role since you can’t do critical role training etc. 

Push for the PS role. Talk to your AM about your development and career goals and ask them to do a plan with you (they’ll ideally Mark this in their ingeniee AA development system used to elevate associates). Hope this helps.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Nobody applies or interviews to be a problem solver. It's just a tier 1 role in stowing like stowing itself or waterspider or whatever. Anybody can just be grabbed and trained on problem solver or told to work that role at any moment. It's totally up to the AM. From my experience, most AM's do have some people that just do roles such as problem solver every once in a while, or as needed, or rotate. Like I said, the way they do it is up to them. You pretty much have to go wherever the boss puts you, that's just the way it works. There are a lot of people that would rather be a problem solver than have to stow. In fact, if I had to guess, I would think a large majority of people in stowing would rather do that. If he doesn't like it, he can transfer to a different department and/or shift. Maybe they'll let him do problem solve there all the time (or maybe they won't at all). 

Who knows why they don't let him problem solve all the time. Maybe the manager is playing favorites, or maybe there's another reason. Sometimes it's hard to tell why they put certain people where. It could be because your husband is fast at stow. If he has a high stow rate they may not want to take him off of that unless they have to (like to train somebody). 

As far as staying late, you just stated that he volunteers to do it. If he doesn't want to keep doing that, he should just choose to stop doing it. Leaving things for the next shift is normal. And if it's the case that they're leaving too much, then it wouldn't be his fault. I think he should just leave at 4:30 every day.",0,t3_dmdfnx,t2_ubzzk,f5040qh,t3_dmdfnx,t5_1387r9,1571921478,URL not found

Welcome to Amazon. It’s trickle down apathy.

Sure. But this isn’t about me. I don’t know you IRL. You might be my new best friend but at this point, what little I know of you from this post… my opinions are based on that.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It took me about a month for the horrible pain in my feet all day/every day to subside more or less, I have bunions and another leg pain issue that contribute to this pain. Initially bringing some icepacks or freezing some water bottles to rest my feet on during lunch were wonderful, but the pain is bearable now so I don't need to do that.  Also those nubby roller massagers were helpful in relieving some of the pain in my feet.
  
I've used sketchers work shoes for years with memory foam but have to add insoles shortly after breaking them in as the memory foam can't handle the time and labor I've done in them at the FC or my other job on concrete floors/stepping up and carrying heavy loads all day.  I brought two pairs of them swapping daily or midday depending on if I felt like it, almost always swap out socks midday as well.  I use with synthetic socks for moisture wicking over cotton that trap your feet in moisture and breed blisters.  I only recently went to 'boot' socks, some with compression but both with moisture wicking and more padding that are even better.
  
I like Sof Sole Insoles and dickies boot socks with my sketchers, I'm going to have to get another pair of shoes soon as one of my pairs was already old from my prior job.",0,t3_dm1rzf,t2_39reeprt,f52ih9n,t3_dm1rzf,t5_1387r9,1571950643,URL not found

Reddit can't help you as much as a manager who are there to help regardless, and it doesn't matter which manager; open door policy to all mangers or HR is the Amazon policy.

 If you were the trainer then you should have informed your Direct AM (Area manager) to deal with the situation or give you guidance. We don't attack or berate new associates regardless of their learning speed. We all have things going on and maybe it was a bad day distracting the AA. All activity regarding performance is automatically evaluated on computers and managers get alerts when necessary.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I am the AA and this incident occurred on Day 1 of a 2 Day training.  After the tour, the Trainer logged into a work station and went through the five steps for pack to be be done.  The AAs watched the trainer perform the steps a few times before being assigned a work station of our own.

The procedures for missing items, upgrading a box, among other issues that may arise for packing orders were explained.  Some of these issues occurred and to be sure the correct procedure was being done we asked before doing to be sure that it was being done.  I was not the only one he raised his voice at repeatedly saying I told you already or what do you not understand...among other things.  No one else said anything about the way he was yelling at them.  I realize before I yelled back at him stating I was not going to let him talk to me that way, I should have just found a manager or informed someone from Learning what was happening.

Day 2 of Training the same thing happened.  I watched and listened as this Trainer yelled at other AAs for asking something that was done on Day 1 our training.  Any questions that came up about a procedure to be done for a missing, upgrade or damaging out items I had, instead of asking the Trainer who was assigned to me, I asked someone in the area I was working with.

comment,AmazonFC,1," Its called labor share in our FC facility. Department staffing is done according to head count and needs of the department. If a department does not have the headcount needed for their department and/or needs help they request for support and an AA is pulled from their current job to work in another department. Unless you are physically unable to work in the area you are being assigned to regardless of the area you were hired for Managers can and have the right to move you to work in another department needs help. Unless you have medical documentation that states you are not allowed to work in a certain area or perform certain duties of a position your manager can move you there.

Check with your HR site to confirm. Staffing is done on the needs of the company/department to get products out.",0,t3_dmtxfc,t2_4bynqqtj,f58aj4r,t3_dmtxfc,t5_1387r9,1572052248,URL not found

If you are trained in a role and are asked to do it, you must comply. Amazon reserves the right to assign you where needed which everyone agrees to in new hire paperwork. An assignment can only be refused if it is legitimately unsafe to do so (such as you are not trained on the applicable equipment, like a VRC), or if you have a documented medical limitation.

Singles rate at my FC is 50uph.

Try not to worry about rate at first. Focus on what you are scanning and making less and less mistakes. It's important to know where to go and what barcode to scan, once you get that, it only takes a little bit more to make rate. 

The new system at my FC is such that only the bottom 5 percent of pickers are coached and retrained. If you are above that then you typically don't have to worry. 

But if you are constantly scanning the wrong barcode or missing out items that are actually in the bins. That's more likely to get you in trouble.",0,t3_dn2bc3,t2_s94up,f594lff,t3_dn2bc3,t5_1387r9,1572071106,URL not found

A. Your facts are wrong, Amazon isn't the wealthiest company in the world. And even if it was, market value and cash flow are two different things.

B. Just because they potentially could, doesn't mean they should. An employer doesn't have any obligation to give its employees any discount. Amazon chooses to, but yet you people are never satisfied. 

&gt;They still make profit when we buy shit so it’s not like they don’t continue making money. 
No one's forcing you to buy from Amazon. You buy from Amazon because you WANT to, and the company isn't responsible for your decisions. You all complain about Amazon business practices and yet you all keep on giving back your salary to the company.

&gt;IMO it should be a limitless discount, as we’re continuing to buy shit and give them profit by using it. Capping it at $100USD is honestly pitiful. 
Yes, a limitless discount. Perfectly reasonable. 

&gt;Even Best Buy offers no cap on their cost+5% discount to staff, which is a way better discount than us, cap or not.
Best Buy has 125,000 employees. Amazon has over five times that. You do the maths.

If you're not happy with the discount then you can always leave for another company. You bitching attitude won't be missed.",0,t1_f5a0r1s,t2_izu2l,f5a5fpp,t3_dnd4wl,t5_1387r9,1572100793,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Lol I’m not bitching nor am I claiming they have any obligation to give a discount - I’m saying in my opinion, they should provide a better discount as part of the incentive package. Being entirely honest - when it comes to hourly employees, Amazon does very little to show appreciation despite them being the backbone of the company. Providing a decent employee discount is industry standard all around the world. Putting a cap on it is not. That’s all I’m saying. Again, a 10% discount for unlimited purchases for all employees barely costs Amazon anything especially since with nearly every purchase, they are making more than what they lose in profit regardless. Will it slow the increase rate of profit? In a small, barely measurable amount, probably, but again - this is about providing even just mediocre incentive to your backbone employees. As managers we get more incentives; hourly don’t get a lot as it is, at least compared to standards around the world.

None of this means I don’t like my job or company, I’m simply giving an opinion that I believe of all things to nickel and dime on, the discount is a poor choice.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I need you to answer a question for me, because I'm very confused right now, lol. At my station, ""problem solve"" is just an indirect role that people (usually ambassadors) get assigned to. For example, on pick&amp;stage aka loadout, there's ""outside PS"" where you just stand outside at a cart with a laptop and help DSP drivers with issues, and there's also cycle 2 quality/PS which is basically fixing missorts/dealing with wrong stations, FC returns, etc. But anyways, are PS/ambassador meant to be separate things? I mean, I know they're technically separate (like, ambassadors are supposed to be trainers/coaches), but is PS also something that has to be applied for, or is it just something you get trained on? At my station we (ambassadors) are basically used as a sort of leadership position, and a lot of the time you'll see ambassadors on indirect roles like PS, quality, sweep, lane audit, etc.

Also, what do all the abbreviations stand for? (PG, SOM, AGM, GM, and I think PA is Process Assistant iirc)",0,t1_f4zs2m1,t2_90u0j,f5k0uva,t3_dmehz2,t5_1387r9,1572250823,URL not found

If it's an FC, whatever your training days are is usually the days and hours you will be working.

At the current prime location I'll be at, you get 3 days of training for two weeks. After that, you have to pick your shifts once a week or so.

comment,AmazonFC,2,"I work at Fresh also. Crazy how the standards of work are different for basically the same department! 

Where I’m at, we use the bubble insulator and put it inside a brown paper bag. And this is for Chilled and Frozen picking paths. The only thing that’s different would be Chilled, you use frozen water bottles (or before we used ice packs) and for Frozen, you use dry ice. 

I’ve been at Fresh for over 2 years now and being myself, a crazy neat freak, all my totes and items are organized neatly and can be closed easily. My rate is far better than those who just toss their items in the bags because in the end, they have to try to organize the bags in order to make their ice fit. 

My best advice for “making everything fit” would be to open the bubble insulators or white plastic bags the best you can. By making the bottom of the bags as flat as you can, you’re ultimately able to fit more things. Ofc practice makes perfect, but with time, you’ll learn tricks to opening the bags easier, flatter, and faster. It might be tedious opening them all nicely, but in the end, it saves time.",0,t3_doa3qx,t2_rdwln,f5nduz9,t3_doa3qx,t5_1387r9,1572299139,URL not found

There's a lot to learn in the company so you might as well start learning on Day 1. If you have anything specific you want to know about, send me a DM.",0,t3_doxcg5,t2_r97wv,f5rj14b,t3_doxcg5,t5_1387r9,1572395505,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,I've been through 2 AEWs and they do differ from site to site. My advice is ask plenty of questions and take notes. The ambassadors giving the training are generally pretty competent in the process at hand and will be a good resource. While you are learning the process be sure to engage with the other associates who are actually doing the job and get their buy in for potential process improvement ideas. It will look really good on you as a new manager to immediately value the input of associates. Good luck and wear comfortable shoes!,0,t3_doxcg5,t2_482lzvyu,f5rj9rp,t3_doxcg5,t5_1387r9,1572395662,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"ICQA is a whole department but what your explaining is the data analyst role. This is a tier 3 and possibly level 4 position where you help the whole building research inventory defects, create SQL queries, and excel macros. 

This job is not an easy one to start as to understand the data you need to understand the entire building at least somewhat. You also need to learn extensive excel formulas and vba and there isn't usually any formal training. However most times that aren't going to expect you to know everything right away and understand you will take awhile to learn.

I feel like the job should not be a tier 3 role for what is expected of you. I make the same money as I did as a PA where I just walked around moving people based on the numbers.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Rehire here- into my first work week now. First time the DT/BC took 3-5 days; this time it was a whopping 13, I had called the corporate hiring number and they said they've had my results- offered me a open shift, next day I get a call from the site hiring team offering me a completely different shift both from my hiring event offer and the corporate offer and saying it was the only shift available,  whatever, took it and boom- started six days after that.

All in all it took 27 days from application to first day- with different information from ever person every step of the way. Worst part is my initial offer was for a permanent position (blue badge), now I'm stuck as a seasonal white badge until conversions open up in Jan/Feb. 

Only plus side is it's 40-60 hours a week at base plus differential bonus but still scary knowing I can be let go after season considering I moved 200 miles for the job. 

TL:DR It depends on your site staffing team, they'll put you where they really want/need you.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Straight up- it can't be helped. Like others pointed out, there's times when the RNG Gods spit on you by dumping a whole pallet of large bulk while AR Bots bring you a congo line of 6in pods. 

Honestly, if they want better productivity they need to actually train and monitor indirects like Water Spiders / Problem Solve- don't dump six huge boxes of identical furniture on one stowers sled- parse that scrap out so you're not tanking one person's productivity- especially when they can only get a half a case out every 5-6 pods because they need that golden size/shape opening.

Hell, I've had stuff thrown on my sled that will NEVER fit in a pod- like, the length is equal or greater to the entire width of a pod stack. Problem solve shrugs and tells me to scan the containers in anyway and piss off. There's not any accountability for those roles if the manager isn't on their A Game. 

Coming from a SC where a manager can see everyone from the sort slide rise it's frustrating seeing my lines problem solver spending 45 minutes flirting and then looking at my stack of bad labels/unregistereds and saying ""Meh, we only have 25 minutes left,"" before walking away.",0,t3_doj55z,t2_2uwyqich,f5shwgu,t3_doj55z,t5_1387r9,1572431270,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Stow is a mind game; a grind. The best tips I can give are these:

Think lazy. Any time you spend walking back and forth from your sled to the pod is time not spent stowing. Steps are your mortal enemy; take as few as possible and only then grudgingly.

Work the pod in a pattern, it doesn't matter what pattern, just have a system so that once you get to *points at a certain part of the pod* **there**... you know that pod is done and it is time to move on to the next one.

Keep the really difficult to stow items *all back of the bus and stuff*. Keep those big 12 inchers and cube like single item cases in the back of your sled, BUT WORK THEM FIRST. Any time a new pod pulls up look for big spaces and try to get that case of greenies, ot whatever your large annoying item is in there first. Only then move on to the rest of your sled.

If there is no space then no biggie.

Stow is a game of good enough. Once you can say good enough move on to the next pod. Dont spend 45 seconds trying to get one item in an already full pods.

Think tetris. Hard to work pieces first, then easier stuff.

Lastly use downtime efficiently. If you are waiting for a pod take that time to organize your sled, or load your sled, or break down boxes or... you get the point. 

That's about it.",0,t1_f5p503w,t2_o3j7j,f5t5eiu,t3_dolmrb,t5_1387r9,1572450826,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"As a former ambassador training managers on AEW, and now as a trainer coordinating AEW my best piece of advice is to ask ""why"".

I have seen lots of new managers only care about the how. They want to learn the how for a few hours before they forget and learn a new how. Fragments of that how stick with them as they go on to a new department; and that new manager is left with only a general understanding of what that department does.

Instead of learning just the how, learn the why. I spent a third of my time with the best manager I did an AEW with doing nothing but walking around the mod answering why. Why it is important to empty totes instead of dropping them. Why that impacts pick. Not just how to stow RSR well, not just what it RSR is, but why we have it in racking. Why we case pick in the first place. Why we limit it to certain stations or break it up. 

What reactive is, why we place priority on it. Why delays in stow can impact CPTs. Why quality is of the utmost importance in stow. Why we place so much importance on problem solve. Etc.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"White badges (which you will start as if your seasonal) accumulate points for days taken off and times your late, I believe for a whole shift missed it 1.5 points. If you accumulate a certain amount of points you won't be able to convert to a blue badge when the time comes for conversions and there is also another point limit that if you hit that number you'll be subject to termination. The point amounts and whatnot should be covered in your paperwork somewhere (not sure where exactly, I just remember reading over it when I first started before I started training). You can use the a to z hub and use the approved time off option to put in for time off whenever you want, even if it's your very first day out of training, but you don't have to do that if you don't want to, the points will be added automatically anyway, putting it in on the hub is more of a work courtesy.",0,t1_f5teh7k,t2_xddvi,f5u18kr,t3_dozr4f,t5_1387r9,1572467111,URL not found

For relocation I'd say if you are able to do it, no ties to your area like family etc, then do it.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Had this same thing happen to me. Searched the internet for any answers thinking I wouldn't get hired or something. My tip for anyone going through this is HARASS THE HELL OUT OF THE HELP LINE. I was supposed to get a notice of my start date  a week after the hiring event. It has been a week and being anxious I kind of searched up if this has happened to others. Some saying ""it takes time"" and others saying they just never flat out got an answer for months. I didn't have time to wait since I put in my two weeks notice for my full time already. 

Go online and chat with them. I say harass bc they'll fuck up a ton along the way. It seems super hit-or-miss depending on which group you get hired with. I know someone who got everything within 2 days.

So yea once you chat with them (online or phone) they'll set up a start date for you (which really shouldn't be there duty to depend on for you to start). You either wait weeks or give it a shot a few days after the hiring event and chat with them, THEY WILL MOST LIKELY GIVE YOU A START DATE SOON.

It is frustrating that I had to go through this and you can never know if you'll be lucky to get an email 2 days or 2 months after the hiring event. Use the help center. Don't have an email for your start date? Use the help center. (It is the best way to have proof that   
 you have an official day. If someone says they made on for you and you did not get an email, then they didn't make it.) Don't have your my docs at least 2 days before your start date? Use the help center.

Again, not sure if I was just in a bad group of people for my hiring event and the background checks took longer than they should have and they wanted to send our group its own mass email of a start date when that was settled, but I wasn't able to wait any longer.

IMHO raise it to your PA, say I think I forgot to scan the bin and do you have any tips that can help me not make this mistake in the future.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I am starting my second week of inbound stow at an ARFC. First half of my first day was touring the FC and going over safety and some stuff we already heard in orientation. 

Second half of first day, we learned the Golden Rules of Stow and got to practice. Don’t try to work on your speed whatever your doing! Work on learning a good routine where you are taking all the steps and creating muscle memory. Looking at your screen is key! 

2nd day- we were assigned new stations and giving feedback from our learning ambassadors about errors and ways to avoid the red screen. 

3rd day- assigned to stations and learning ambassadors continue to help us be more productive by helping keep good organization at our stations, eg., keep a variety of sizes to stow on your front loading area and always keep 8-10 bins signed in. Always try to stow 8-10 items in a pod and at the very least stow 1 item. 

4th day- pretty much on our own to practice what we’ve learned. Focus on working smarter and still not worrying about speed yet. 

I was told, After 160 hours of work, we will be expected to stow at a certain rate. 

I was only sore in my back between my shoulder blades because I am pretty physically fit and my legs are really strong from always doing lunges. I had co-workers next to me though, who could barely make it up the stairs the 2nd day because they were so sore. 

This is a physical job. If you are a person who gets tired standing, order some compression socks. They energize your legs! Put your feet up on breaks. Get 2 pairs of good shoes and rotate daily. Break them in before you start. 

Eat low carb and higher protein on lunch and breaks. Drink water! Carb load your body when you get home from your shift to have energy for the following day. 

I’ve enjoyed working at an ARFC so far (only 2nd week, so take this with a grain of salt). The people I’ve met are super chill and I’ve made some new friends. 

I like that my mind and body are always working and when I go home, the job is done and there isn’t any work I have to take home.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Really depends on the building and who is in management. 

* My first building this never happened in during the two years I was there. 
* The second building which was a launch FC it happened all to much to the point we had a 90% turnover rate in stow to complement the 80% building wide turnover rate, I transferred out after nearly a year. 
* My current building I have been at nearing three years and I have seen it happen a couple times but those managers tend to disappear when it does unless the person really messes up which we had a stower get fired week one for never scanning a product for a whole day.

While the last instance I deem unfair to the associate as that was most likely a failure in training and the ambassador did not see any repercussions, sadly there is nothing we can really do to change that. I know this because during my time at the second building a good majority of us vets that transferred in fought against upper management on how giving week one right-ups was just setting the associate up for failure and causing a higher turnover rate.",0,t1_f601wbk,t2_gjcmyo2,f612rp2,t3_dpw4rm,t5_1387r9,1572631761,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Trynaman made a very good reply to your question.  If you need time off for personal or medical, instead of resigning request a PLOA (Personal Leave of Absence) or MLOA (Medical Leave of Absence) contact the LOA team (Leave of Absence).  Doing this will allow you to keep your benefits without losing them and having to start over again.   If you need time off they can assist you with your request.  Reach out to HR at your site or contact ERC and ask to speak with the LOA department.

You will be able to keep your benefits and remain as an Amazon employee when your return from your leave.  Check with HR to see what the time frame is for PLOA due to the fact that peak season is coming up for the cut off date to apply.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Not officially, but as the pods become more and more full as peak continues we stowers sometimes have to get a bit ""creative"" if we want any chance of keeping our rates/ TAKT in an acceptable range. I think we were at something like 109% pod holding/space capacity at my FC, and management has started going around with an updated training regimen that tells us it's now OK to block and stack items so long as the items behind are visible or the tape in front of the bins can safely hold the stacked items. A lot of us don't like it, but we're effectively being forced into doing it. 

Unfortunately, the improper stowing also has something of a domino effect. The more that people improperly stow, the harder it becomes to stow into those bins/pods, so you're in turn forced to improperly stow and item at times, which means the next person has the same issue, and the next, etc. etc.

I always cringe a little when I get pods now, knowing that some poor picker is going to have to deal with them.",0,t3_dqz4jx,t2_kj5oq3q,f6c5n4m,t3_dqz4jx,t5_1387r9,1572782548,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"There are two stats tied to your pods, NST (No Stow Turnaway) and UPF (Units per Face). If you send a pod away without stowing anything, both those stats get worse and you can expect some talks with your PA/Manager if it happens too much. I think it plays into your quality or something.

On my team, they only want us having no more than 7 NSTs per shift and at least 8 units per pod atm. If you get a large item/pod you obviously can't stow 8 of those, so you have to overcompensate on a smaller pod by cramming as many items in as quickly as you can to make up for the larger ones.",0,t1_f6cccst,t2_kj5oq3q,f6crent,t3_dqz4jx,t5_1387r9,1572787942,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I don't think so. What you get is what you stow, regardless of how large, bulky, or heavy it is. There's not really a place to set aside larger items, so you're going have to stow it anyways. We also operate on the First in, First out system, so if you get a bunch of large/bulky items at the start you can get fucked over pretty fast if you don 't stow like a madman.


The only exception is the if the item exceeds 18 inches, at which point it's non-complaint and a problem solver takes it away. In the last six months I've only ever seen two such non-com boxes though.

Edit* Something to keep in mind is that we're limited by how many totes we can be signed into at any given point in time. So we have to plan out our stow sleds around the incoming pods, totes, and what we already have. Since we don't get to pick our pods (Computer does it) you generally try to cram as many items into as few pods as possible to keep a large-time backup from forming. Since those take the longest to stow, they need to get out ASAP as you don't want to be signed into more than three at a time.",0,t1_f6d44kv,t2_kj5oq3q,f6d5whb,t3_dqz4jx,t5_1387r9,1572791629,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"You need to understand that there are multiple positions if they allow you to convert, Front half of the week (sun-wed) Doughnut Shift (Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri) and Back Half (Wed-Sat). then it's a matter of days or nights(graveyard).

People are constantly moving including moving around (positions/shifts) full time AA's and Managers, as well as PA's. If you learn your job given to you quickly make rate which is not the way most people make it out to be, just do the job, be friendly and work at a decent pace. all positions are straight forward and you will be trained in whichever (most likely Pack). 

Getting along with your direct AM as well as other AM's within your shift  and the PA's, most of them will be easy to start to build a professional relationship with, if not or you feel offset, form a regular standing with another manager, But most importantly show hustle and get on good terms with your assigned Am, that doesn't mean to overwork yourself or burnout. Check in with your AM every now and then because chances are they won't be standing right near you, just don't stop your task to walk away and find your manager to chat. 

Chances are at this stage close to peak it will be a Pack Position. It's really simple packing and the speed at which you go through your packages is up to you, so long as your within rate. 

*The key I cannot stress* is **NOT** to push so hard that you burn out, don't forget you have a learning curve to which you have to make a certain % of the given rate which increase during the first weeks. This applies to all positions. Any hope for converting or even moving up after means speaking with HR and express your interested to your manger as well as ask PA's if they can point you in the right direction. Sometimes AA's misunderstand the best root to move up . 

As far as standing in 1 place not not really there are breaks, lunch, and lots of pivoting and some squatting if you bend correctly to put or get items. All sites have stand-up where they give announcements while stretching. plus you walk back and forth in the job even if it's a small amount of moving. 

**TLDR**: Don't be nervous, get your assigned job done, you move not much but you also don't stand still, get along with your direct manager, be friendly with fellow AA's whether their full time or seasonal , and lastly, express you interest to PA's or Managers who can help in the long run.

 And as far as bad to work for no, you have to know what your coming in to, it will be manual labor on your feet for however long your shift is. I've seen all ages and weight classes just go through the motions to  get it done.  Your able to go to the bathroom, just don't go every 5 minutes. only if you need to because a full shift (10 hours) comes with 2 breaks and a lunch.

PA is a tier 3 full time AA's are tier 1 I'm not sure how seasonal fits in, even then becoming a PA takes time a track record an application when there's an opening and if your lucky an interview with HR and AM's I believe. If that is your goal first expect it to take time without counting your seasonal time. 

Hope some of this kind of makes sense and helped. Best of Luck",0,t3_dqu0n5,t2_2s9sc5gw,f6db3h0,t3_dqu0n5,t5_1387r9,1572792862,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Are you talking about the Amazon boxes with the smile logo and everything? Or boxes in general?

As a packer, I work with the Amazon boxes for several hours every week and I still hate the smell. I always thought they smelled nasty.

Technically they're ""fresh"" and unfolded, but it's likely that warehouses store them in pallets for a while in God-knows-what condition before making their way to our packing stations. It's not uncommon to see flies hanging around or even in these unfolded stacks of boxes.

Also, warehouses are filthy. From the totes, to the equipment we work with - they don't see much downtime so they constantly touch stuff and get thrown around in equally filthy environments. 

I'm never going to forget the one time I pulled some wrapped food-items from a tote and saw a couple of wasps writhing in a corner from being semi-crushed by it. Just...ew. And how.",0,t3_dr1h56,t2_4lelgb3l,f6dle9s,t3_dr1h56,t5_1387r9,1572795159,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Your rate is expected to be 220/hr. My current rate is 298/hr, highest is 439/hr.
My advice for you is to FOCUS. My line lead typically assigns me 3 aisles, so I'll start there by stowing the middle and maybe 2 handfulls of jiffys before I go to the next aisle to give my stow buffers some room. Once they're stowed from the middle, I'll grab the oversize. Then I work the entire section of where I'm assigned, so all of A or whatever lane I'm on.
Stow buffers LOVE when you accommodate them by keeping them able to place things on their racks.
When you're stowing jiffys, throw the things in the bags, adjust later. Jiffys are what helps with my rate because they're so small. Oversize will slow your rate, so be mindful of that.
Also, during a very slow period or on your breaks, log out of Dolphin to save your rate.

2. Drink water. Being a clear water bottle to work and keep on sipping from it all shift. Drink lots of water on your days off.

3. Bring good and comfortable shoes. Look into insoles. Look into compression socks. But good and comfortable shoes are a must. 

4. Remember that people are human and be gracious when they make mistakes. Nobody is here for the sole reason of screwing everyone else over. Do not allow the mistakes of others to ruin your day.

5. Come in a bit early. The parking lot will be packed. People will be rushing around like madmen trying to get home. Come in a bit early so you have time to get a parking space and make the hike to the front door.",0,t3_drf3z2,t2_o3j7j,f6i3dem,t3_drf3z2,t5_1387r9,1572871193,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,Are you applying for a transfer to another department as a promotion or a transfer to another department with the same level.  If its a transfer same level you do not need 10 hrs of UPT TIME.  Read the eligibility requirements and make sure it states UPT of 10 hours needed.  Apply for the position anyway if its a promotion they may make an exception.  Speak with you manager and see what they say.  If you have PTO time apply the time you were late using it and your hour of UPT will not be used.  Speak with HR since you were in conversation with them during this and see if they can apply any other time you have for the minutes you were with them.  Never assume something can not be done.  It does not hurt to ask.  You never know.,0,t3_dr56y7,t2_4bynqqtj,f6iccsp,t3_dr56y7,t5_1387r9,1572876041,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Aside from the advice everyone else gave that I would echo, I would say that now is the time to really be by the book. Example: if it were an FC where the 'rules' state that if someone is behind you, you should pick X number of items before exiting the aisle (if you're on PIT) to let the other person take a turn. A lot of people won't call this out (if you're behind someone), and they'll let the other person continue picking. During peak you should be calling this out (in a friendly/constructive manner obviously) so that you actually have the time to make rate and be productive.

However this type of scenario may apply to your site, make sure you engage with and be vocal with your fellow associates and leadership to make sure whatever barriers you encounter are dealt with immediately. Increased headcounts can cause a lot of issues, don't let small problems fester.",0,t3_drf3z2,t2_11p1ke,f6ide97,t3_drf3z2,t5_1387r9,1572876563,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Most of the others cover it but the biggest thing I've found is you should buy 2 pairs of shoes. Rotate them every day. Spending up to 12 hours on your feet will compress the insole and giving them a full day to decompress instead of a few hours while you sleep will make your peak a lot more enjoyable.

Also, make sure to break in your shoes before going to work in them. Having brand new kicks looks nice but you're going to be in for a world of hurt your first week of wearing them. Wear them when you're not at work and your days off for a couple weeks to break them in and you'll be good to go.",0,t3_drf3z2,t2_xy05j,f6idgkd,t3_drf3z2,t5_1387r9,1572876596,URL not found

As stated by others, drinks lots of water, avoid heavy meals.  Bring plenty of snacks to eat during the day.  Fruit and trail mix are a good source of energy.  The best thing to do is stay positive.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If you’ve literally only been working one week, then you’re still in your learning curve and it’s to be expected that you won’t meet rate. I can’t speak for pack but in stow, we had to be at 70% after the first week, 80% after the second, 90% at the third and 100% after the fourth week, which is when learning curve is over. 

Also, at least at my facility, only the bottom 5% got write ups. You’d have to consistently perform bad for that to happen or get on the bad side of a PA. It takes like 6 write ups to get fired but I e heard of it happening after 3. Don’t worry about that. Do the best you can do and just do your job. 

Lastly, congrats on the conversion. Now you have a little more job security. You also get PTO and benefits. Take advantage of the benefits.

Put some effort in and easily avg 55 which I always set as a benchmark for myself to beat.,0,t3_dru376,t2_3npg2r8z,f6mb7xs,t3_dru376,t5_1387r9,1572969781,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Stretching is incredibly important. Should always target problem areas every day, even your off days. If you start to have more than just mild discomfort after the first month of working, you should speak to your AM and AMCare about it. RSI and RMI are a real thing and you should take care of yourself.

I'd suggest doing [this](https://youtu.be/fdD7CgN5FGg?t=126) before work, at lunch and after work at a minimum. It doesn't take long to do and you're paying forward. Your futute self will thank you.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You've got time before your learning curve is up. If you're still having trouble after your second week with getting closer to rate, I'd suggest asking your PA and AM for coaching. They'll appreciate you wanting to learn and will normally go out of their way to help you. You could also ask to be labor tracked for 20-30 minutes so you can shadow and observe a top veteran packer. I work at a legacy FC with mixed rate singles which means we get smalls, mediums and larges. Our mixed rate is 91 but any veteran packer can easily do 110 and some like myself can do a maintained rate of 180+ with burst rates in excess of 200. Every single one of us are more than willing to help out new people and veterans alike so they can pack more effectively. All you have to do is ask! If your FC posts rates somewhere, be sure to have a look and see what the top tier packers rates look like so you can get an idea and who to ask.

If you do all that and still can not make rate, they'll see that you're trying and willing to learn. They'll move you around until they find your sweet spot path. I've known people who couldn't make rate in several departments and got moved around for months until they found one they enjoyed and excelled at. Put the effort in, ask questions and you'll be just fine.",0,t3_dru376,t2_xy05j,f6mp0nk,t3_dru376,t5_1387r9,1572976310,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Pretty much. At my location, this was considered as a “reward”, if you will, for being good. It got you away from the monotony of stowing/picking/packing and enables you to move around some, thus making the day go by faster. Though, recently they did hire people directly into the water spider role. Anyways, for stow, screw that. Water spider sounds good but you get worked into the ground. You’ll be much more tired and have many more aches. You also have more responsibility and get the same pay. Only benefits are no rates and that you get to move around some. But don’t let me stop you.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"i myself just started working ICQA (CSBC) very recently. tbh, training wise, i feel like i got 4 minutes training and was kinda thrown out there, gun in hand, to count. i wish we had started with a handbook, that had all the acronyms, error codes, FAQ etc., for example. this way, if i had a question, i wouldn't have to walk around like a chicken with it's head cut off, trying to flag down a PA, who could be anywhere on two vast floors. I got some advice around here to try KNET to look for stuff, but having problems accessing their servers (externally) so i have to go Amazon and view from there. i'm use to working in places where your managers will tell you if you are having a problem, or rather, if there is a problem with your work, here, i don't have a clue if i am doing things correctly or not. is that good that i haven't been approached? some other workers say i'm not here long enough to worry and that you'll know if there's a problem before long. one will either be transferred out or let go.  if that's true, that doesn't seem right or fair tbh. it's like, we're monitoring you all this time, now we're not going to tell you if you're effing up alot or not, we'll just let you continue and tell you if you suck or not after 3 or 4 weeks, then we'll decide then what to do with you.",0,t3_cykgb3,t2_4xx9f5rc,f6n4zgo,t3_cykgb3,t5_1387r9,1572984868,URL not found

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to add make sure you are eating well, take on extra calories than normal so you have the energy needed. Maybe bring an extra sandwich, just in case, you aren't at your best mentally when you are feeling hunger pains, that could lead to injuries or big mistakes 

Dress comfortable, maybe get a fresh new pair of shoes.

Take advantage of the free hot drinks if it's cold in your warehouse or you work in the yard.

Be extra mindful of being safe, stretch,bend at knees, lift load and keep in you power zone.

In my FC, you're allowed 1 false pick short per 5000 picks - that's a 200 DPMO.  But, it's really easy to not create a false pick short if you follow standard work.

comment,AmazonFC,1,No. It literally makes no sense why a counter would do that. All you do for cycle count is scan bin and scan each item in the bin (that you see. Like the other person said there is no list of items that you are looking for) . There is no indicator that there is an error or missing item. All the counter knows is that the bin is potentially defective. An SBC counter knows less - all they do is count the physical number of items in bin and enter it into the scanner.,0,t3_dsyphf,t2_fe0ni,f6st5z8,t3_dsyphf,t5_1387r9,1573139412,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Even though I’m a picker, I’ve been trained to and occasionally do SBC. In SBC we count all items in bin and enter the number in to the scanner. If the count isn’t the number of items expected in the bin (the number doesn’t match expected inventory if you’re first to count or doesn’t match what a previous SBC counter entered as there are 2-3 SBC counts for a missing item) it beeps and we have to recount and enter the number again. Counters get quality errors when the number they count doesn’t match with what at least one of the the other two counters enter, so it would make no sense for them to purposely screw you. 

What might happen though is say an overstuffed bin has an item fall on the floor before it gets to to you. Item is picked up by amnesty sent to stow and they re-stow it before counters get the pod, then you could possibly get an accidental quality error as a picker. Also if you pissed off the right/wrong amnesty person, in theory if you walk away from a station without signing out they could sabotage you by moving an item out of the bin that the computer is telling you to pick while you’re in the restroom pissing instead, and since they can track individual pods, then they simply find said pod after you entered missing item and put item directly back in to it somewhere in the confines of the AR floor. You’d really have to piss off somebody to get them to pull that move though as it could mess up their response times and give them quality errors. So basically be nice to amnesty and/or fully sign out of your station anytime you leave you it. 

If you almost never get false pick short errors, ask you OPs manager sometime to show you specifically which item you missed. If you have a decent relationship with them, then they’ll find the item in the system, so you can know what you missed. For me three weeks ago it was a tiny ass make up thing that probably was no bigger than a US Quarter in diameter and maybe a half inch thick.",0,t3_dsyphf,t2_4noia19,f6t314r,t3_dsyphf,t5_1387r9,1573143307,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Our time off task for morning stand up and break etc. it adjusted automatically for us. We do not have to do anything on the scanners. Throughout the rest of the day (while working) you need to keep scans within 5 minutes of each other to avoid TOT. (Anything past 5 minutes starts counting towards TOT). 

This is at my building in Southern California. I can’t assure that it’s the same at yours, although likely similar. 

If there is something you have to do on the scanner, your managers should have no issue understanding your question and giving you an answer. Or HR.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"First week of training in pick and ICQA main focus is on **QUALITY** not on rate.  You may have an item that has 10 pieces that look the same but is not the same which is why you need to scan each item individually especially in pick.  The main thing to remember is MISSING is something you never want to unless you are absolutely positive it is **MISSING**.  Its time consuming to pick every item in a  bin especially if it involves so many pieces to be done.  Never go by what you think you see.  Take each item out, Scan each item and feel around the bin to make sure it is definitely not there before pressing **MISSING**/.Due to the fact that you are in training, if an item is not in the bin after scanning each pieced individually have a PA or your learning ambassador to check it again to make sure it is in fact missing.  Be careful during your 30 day write up for this because of quality,  Any ongoing errors during this 30 days will automatically develop into a 2nd write up which is 60 days.  

During peak no transfers are being done until January 1 and because you are a new hire you would have to wait 30 days before you could put in for a transfer anyway.  Any questions or concerns for clarification on eligibility regarding transfers reach out to your HR site or contact ERC,",0,t3_dskb1f,t2_4bynqqtj,f6ugcb6,t3_dskb1f,t5_1387r9,1573162523,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1. Drink LOTS of Water.  I do not sweat much... but I feel much better drinking water throughout the night.  I drink about 3 bottles of water throughout the shift.  
2. Listen to your 'veteran' co-workers.  They have great tips a lot of times.  I have a co-worker who has been with amazon for over 6 years and he knows every trick in the book.  
3. Be safe!  If you see a box laying on the ground, PICK IT UP.  Anything someone can slip on, just pick.... it..... up!!!
4. Make sure you are on time for each shift.  Our building allows us a 5 minute grace period, before and after your scheduled shift.  I punch in always at 6:25pm, and punch out from 4:55-5:00am.  Time rounds up according to my AM.
5. You aren't allowed to work more than 12 hours as a FC Associate (tier 1), and no more than 60 hours.  Most places keep big track on this.... but we had a AM get in trouble during Prime Week since he was not keeping track on peoples hours.  
6. Save your PTO/UPT.  I hate to say this... but save it for maybe taking Christmas off!  At our site, PTO ends 12/31, so I am saving every minute till Christmas.

comment,AmazonFC,1,TOT (Time off Task)  are the minutes since your last scan was done.  If you scan an item and have no other scanning for say 10 - 15 minutes or more without logging out than you need to let someone know if it was because of an issue that prevented you from working during this time so that your time can be adjusted.. 30 minutes or more is a warning with no issues for not scanning and if you have an hour of TOT you can receive a final written for non work related issue of TOT.  Reach out to your PA for information when you need to report TOT to  be adjusted accordingly when needed so that it will not go against you.,0,t3_dt0wq3,t2_4bynqqtj,f6ujhex,t3_dt0wq3,t5_1387r9,1573163758,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"This is only speculation and based off of reports of Amazonians that have been through peak season before me, as I’ve only been with the company since July. 

From what I’ve gathered, most of the White badge employees that you seed will be laid off. Some will get converted to blue badge but if I were to estimate a percentage, I’d say maybe between 10 - 20% will still be there. Of course, this depends on how many employees quit during peak, as these upcoming work hours are going to be tougher than most estimate.",0,t3_dtb3no,t2_g624g,f6wbooq,t3_dtb3no,t5_1387r9,1573222530,URL not found

Place item in bin. Keep hand on item. If it fits appropriately, scan bin, remove hand.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I’m a fairly new AM (L5). I came into this role with 5 years of Ops Management experience and my masters. While my previous role gave me higher level responsibilities; managing the finances of 2 accounts, forecasts, monthly accruals, staffing of over 100 associates, managing customer relations, this role still provides a decent learning curve. I feel they are also compensating me well for it. 

Even though you have a lot of experience, an L5 may not be a bad starting point and you can still very well crack 100k/year, but I would still shoot for an L6 if I were you. Beyond that would be very difficult to get into and I’d imagine the learning curve could be pretty substantial.

In terms of work life balance, it seems that it’s facility specific. Some are working 5-6 days a week while others are bairly feeling peak and working a standard 4 day work week. It’s honestly somewhat of a crap shoot. 

My experience so far has been great and I’m happy in my role. Don’t let all the bad things you read deter you",0,t3_dtt6px,t2_4s46uar6,f71pxh8,t3_dtt6px,t5_1387r9,1573345520,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Before peak it was definitely possible, but things are a bit different now with how over-stuffed pods are. I'm currently in the top 5 stowers on my team despite regularly hitting a 10.8-12.7 sec takt time, expecting a 10 sec takt time is really pushing their luck. That kind of takt time requires some astronomical luck with pods and a babysitting WS gifting you all the smalls, neither of which are likely during peak. Definitely achievable outside of peak, just not now.
It's your first week though, so don't sweat it. You're on a learning curve so you're good, and your managers likely know that the takt time is unrealistic. It's just a standard they have to tell us to meet regardless.


Something to keep in mind as well is that your takt time for smalls is different from medium/large. If you can, shoot for a 5 sec takt time on your smalls (this was the pre-peak takt time for smalls, and is still relatively doable) and a 10-15 sec takt time on medium/large items. This should help bring down the overall average.",0,t3_du2qpm,t2_kj5oq3q,f728hvu,t3_du2qpm,t5_1387r9,1573355671,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It's not realistic but you'll survive.  I consistently don't hit the goals but I'm able to make it work for my rate, you just have to capitalize on when you get a good box. A few hints....get to work on time, sometimes if you're consistently late they just won't have a stow station ready for you and you'll have to wait to get one.  The faster you have a station, the faster you can get to it and you can have a fast start.  Come back early from your second break...if you have the ""scan to scan"" policy at your FC get back to work on time and again fast start.  Also learn where the clock in and clock out terminals are.  Lets say i'm at a far corner on the 4th floor and when my shift ends I have to walk to the clock out terminal on the first floor close to the entrance.....that takes about 5 to 6 minutes of you on the clock and not stowing.  On my 4th we have a clock out terminal ...I utilize it when my shift ends immediately. If you have to go to the restroom go to the restroom ...but, if your break is at 2:15 and you kinda wanna go to the restroom at between 1:45 and 2:15....again if you can just wait until break.  Of course if you know yourself and you can hold it in just go to the restroom.  Rearrange your boxes and totes in a way so that the better ones are the closest to you.  Make sure you have your safety knife ready just in case you have to decan you own stuff.  When you need a double decan ask for a double decan, don't do it yourself.  If you have downtime ask your AM to get it coded in for you.  Those are my tips from the top of my head.",0,t3_du2qpm,t2_4unzyog,f77al5q,t3_du2qpm,t5_1387r9,1573448891,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"How is that? They send a deposit notice to the bank and hold the funds until then? Because some people at my site don't get their money until a day or 2 after pay day because the bank has to process the deposit.

At Harris teeter, they sent out pay stub's by Friday and I got my money on Sunday. Meaning Harris teeter sent the fund's to my bank that Sunday to be processed for Tuesdays payday. Since my bank for direct deposits (Greendot) pays up to 2 days faster, they give me that money immediately. So I'm saying amazon must not be sending money out until payday.

Your AM can however, block you from taking VTO. Anyone who's in a critical role might be blocked from taking VTO (problem-solve). Your AM also has an 'instant VTO' tool that he can use to technically VTO anyone they wish.

The only people that are placed on PIP's are people who are actually under-performing. If you recently helped launch an FC, you should have received feedback from Operations.

If you're having medical issues that are effecting your ability to work, they need to know, otherwise they're going to take this the wrong way.

They aren't going to retaliate against you, this is against our conduct and ethics standards.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I appreciate your seeking to understand and reply. This situation happened the day before I posted this, so it is all very fresh and new.  I was placed on a PIP at the end of the day, which was also my Friday. Since I was in path all day, I could not seek advice without accruing TOT. I am trying to figure out all my options before my work week starts on Wednesday.

This was the first time in over a year, at any FCs I have been at, that I have let my medical condition directly affect my work. The same day I asked to stow, I disclosed the information with my direct AM so he was aware it is not going to be a recurring theme and he said I was not obligated to.  We have another PA, and two seasonals, and it was ok for me to take a step back as there was more than enough coverage. 

One of the managers on the another shift were able to connect me with a more experienced and reliable HR rep on nights who is looking into the circumstances of being placed on a PIP, and how the steps leading up to that should have been done. He already stated how this happened was not following policy. I will file my complaint through him so he can throughly explain my options as he will be most knowledgable on the subject.",0,t1_f7822y7,t2_3rc3pkzd,f78f2uu,t3_dugmbl,t5_1387r9,1573492011,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I work at the SMF1 fulfillment center, and I know a person who was sent to HR and forced to do an on the spot swab test because a PA told HR she thought the person smelled like weed. He was actually clean as a whistle and passed the weed test. So yes in Sacramento Amazon cares about cannabis consumption. Oral tests are good for 12-48 hours for detection window, so basically just smoke when your ""weekend"" starts and stop at least a day before you have to go back in for a shift.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Actually, I did NOT feel that ...... wonderful to leave cause I made and met a few good friends and some REALLY REALLY nice people. Not sure whether they will stay in touch or not, but I told them to NOT be a stranger and reach to me IF they need a listening ear or advice, etc etc. I'm that type of person. BUT, I had to go in order to take care of myself - mental and physical health AND make use of my degree. I did not work for a few years after college - reasons, not here on Reddit, so I chose Amazon as a way to built back my résumé. After working a while in two Fulfillment Centers, I see that my college degree would get me ANYWHERE in there. I really didn't have a Rate cause I was cross-trained and all over the place, any given day. I was depressed some - just the idea of going into work, always on the go, in a bad mood when I was home, not enough sleep, always rushing to get things done at home on my days off, etc etc. 

I knew I would NOT last too long there. I couldn't do it until the ripe age of 65, though the money and benefits were good. I know I also needed a home-life and time to walk the cats in the woods. 

So I now find myself ""starting over"" to gain useful transferrable work skills and out that damn degree to use. So I'm starting out small and will built on that. The skills I've learned at Amazon as a Tier1 are useless (for me) in other field - management. However, the skills are good IF one wants to continue working in warehouses/distribution areas. 

Not SURE WHY I writing all of this to you, ................ but, my point is, to guys/gals, think about what sort of [transferrable working skills] you are learning at Amazon and think about what you are going to do, down the road in 5 to 10 years. I understand many need the job, the money, and the benefits. I'm lucky to have some financial help/freedom.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Have to address your - ""feeling drained mentally and physically..."", the feeling is real. You know your situation and what you need to do - even IF that means working at Amazon for while. You're going to keep feeling like that cause the work is mental and physically draining. Amazon seems to don't care nor wants to [improve their working conditions - 8 hrs shift, switch shift 2x a day, 1 hr lunch, longer breaks]. Going from Tier1 to a PA is a lot harder than most people think. You have keep making Rates, on the hour, every hour, every work day. Longer hours per shift and more days. Those things will never change. Though the money is good and VERY good at times, it's a trap to keep the workers coming back. 

It's slavery at its best, but with a good pay and benefits. You can ONLY decide what to do and where you want to go. If it means, starting out small to get somewhere big down the road .... in 5/10 years, then small steps will lead to that, plus there will be all sort of bullshit to deal with along to way, like everything else in life.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Can't comment on IB, I'd imagine it is less stressful but OB isn't very stressful to begin with.  I suppose it depends on your own mindset and whether the people above you are giving you grief/riding you.    
  
Compared to picking it is better in that you don't have any real 'rate', if you are constantly BSing or standing around you'll probably be noticed and moved somewhere if not off the dock, especially during peak.  On the dock there is down time where you are waiting on product, process, etc but they don't chase you down and penalize you because of it if you aren't habitual about standing around while others could use your help.  I've seen people standing around 10-20mins because we were waiting for the next shipment etc.  But so long as you don't stand there doing nothing while people around you are working and you can assist in any way you're pretty much fine.  
  
Only titles I could guess would be the groups of IB vs OB.  IB should be simpler in just receiving goods and unloading them, minor inspection, count/condition/item, etc but again I haven't worked IB.",0,t3_dw9ejl,t2_39reeprt,f7hrfg1,t3_dw9ejl,t5_1387r9,1573746143,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You are the ONLY who can make that choice. IF you're in-need of the money, then you may have to stay put until January. IF you are in pain, fatigue, depression ... then you maybe better leaving. I don't know your situation and I understand some have it really hard and have to stay at job that they don't feel good about. At the same time, the work load gets easier come January, until Prime Week in June/July. Probably half of those workers are either Temp or most likely, will leave come January. I know half of my co-workers were planing on leaving in January/ February. 

Not sure what age you are, but IF you have many years before retirement, then think about what you will do after leaving amazon, what is your short and long term plan for work/living. What are your skills and where can you apply them and built on them as well. Know that you are NOT married to Amazon and that job, you can leave or take a leave of absent and come back or no. 

IF you have zero motivation to move up or it's hard to get into a non-direct roll or a PA or a PS, then you might want to look else for work. 

With me saying this, I understand that Amazon is the bread n' butter for some and it is a very hard place to be as many do not have as many options as others. Do what is best for you and your well-being and as well as your financial well-being.

comment,AmazonFC,1,You have to convert to blue badge before you can apply to jobs using jobfinder. When that happens is completely up to your station. I waited 4 weeks. But some in my station had to wait 9 months for conversions to be available. And to use the jobfinder internal site you have to be on an amazon computer that is connected to the amazon network through a VPN key. However there is an external site with most of the same listings(amazon.jobs) but you will not be treated as an internal hire if you use it... And technically right now you aren't an internal hire anyways since you're seasonal.,0,t3_dwdmuo,t2_23luoa5y,f7j2s4r,t3_dwdmuo,t5_1387r9,1573769667,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I was quoted 25hrs as 'normal' pt-fresh associate but worked more than that before they flooded the building with new hires and shifts dried up.  We were told we could do more, though not disclosed how much, only that if we worked crazy hours like 80+ a week someone would talk to us but perhaps they don't bother and limit you, it isn't hard to do with scripts.  
  
I actually could signup for more than 25hrs a week if I was willing to work overnight/evenings with no shift differential, no benefits, etc that everyone else who isn't a fresh gets but I won't.  
  
My own experience is that there may be some tailoring into allowing certain or specific fresh employees to work shifts that others don't ""see"" or are delayed.  It is pure speculation on my part but more than once, before the building was flooded with new hires, I'd log into the fresh shift site and within 5-10minutes new shifts would pop up I could snatch, some stuck around for days because I never claimed them.  After those occurances ended there were shifts that sat unclaimed by the hundreds of new employees I could grab if I wanted, not just overnight/evenings either.  
  
 I'd suggest if you don't want to deal with limited hours, assuming you are not seeing extra hours to grab like me, you look for another job or transfer to a FT shift in another building unless you truly believe your FC, direct managers and the building managers you've likely never seen care about you.  I've come to the conclusion that they don't care about me or the ones who do have no say in my employment status/shifts when the building keeps hiring more and more people for me to 'fight' for shifts.",0,t3_dwub56,t2_39reeprt,f7mtr88,t3_dwub56,t5_1387r9,1573873458,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"When we are overloaded with too many people it is just because the FC hires so many people expecting most to quit.  Of the 20 people I started with only 3 still work there.  They throw loads of people on things because they either need it done fast, have too many people and no other work or place to put them.  This is especially true if they haven't bothered to properly train people because it means they can't be put to work in many places without having them make mistakes.
  
When I sorted from our belt I'd go over to the other belt if mine wasn't getting anything then go back when something came down.  
  
I've heard problem solve isn't easy to get, as in everyone wants it and depending on your managers it may only go to their favorites.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Idk what wrapdown is.... Might just be a terminology I don't know though. Is your whole shift sortation? 

Anyways. Yes the training sucks. But the training for the trainers sucks.. so it's not surprising. Realistically however asking people for tips and just doing it is more effective in my opinion than the training.

Unless your station is just using way too many scanners there shouldn't be people in your way while you're scanning.i would ask your lane ambassador if they care for you to switch lanes when volume is low. We do allow people to move around if they want but for the most part we like to have scanners stay on their lane. It just makes it easier to keep track of how many scanners we have. 

Make sure you log out of dolphin whenever there isn't any packages to scan. Try to pack bags as neatly as you can and it'll eliminate having to close lots of bags.

Overall what positions are ""easy"" is dependent on what you find easy. If you want something fairly physically easy. That'd be diverting or scanning in induct.",0,t3_dx54il,t2_4jpjvcup,f7nj560,t3_dx54il,t5_1387r9,1573906399,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"To be clear.. problem solve is in no way the easiest roll. As a tier 1 you have the MOST responsibility and can brutally mess things up potentially. It's kindof like choosing to work on a bombsquad. You could save the day... Or mess up every package in the building and cost amazon thousands/lose your job. It isn't easy to get into because there's only so many needed on each shift. And considering you'll likely just shadow a current problem solver for ""training"" I'm sure there's lots of different quality problem solvers. The only real training I received was my hazmat certification. Problem solve imo is the most fun position I've had because I enjoy the mental challenge.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Not a lot of upward mobility with Ambassador unless you want to go the fairly limited path of Learning such as Trainer, Coordinator, etc.

Upward mobility generally goes from a PG role to PA. See if you can become a PG. If not that, then a PS.

Just my two cents from Operations. But I can tell you for sure that in most cases, being an Ambassador actually can limit opportunities in Ops because generally they won’t put someone into a critical role like a PG if they’re an Ambassador due to commitments to Learning that Ops cannot do anything about (Learning will fight tooth and nail to keep an Amb they’ve already invested in).

comment,AmazonFC,1,"In the sort center I work at wrapdown usually fixes the pallets that the last sort has left behind and moves them to the trucks they need to go to. I second what everyone is saying about asking your coworkers for tips. Most decent people will be happy to answer quick questions or give you tips on how to do things. 

I know it sounds corny, but make sure to focus on sorting packages onto the pallets well over just pure rate. My rate wasn't spectacular (still within what they asked us to have) but I made sure to try my best to do things right and help fix any pallets that looked like a disaster waiting to happen.  Take any chances to try things if a PA or ambassador asks you to do an indirect task like splitter or sort slide. You might find you like something you never thought you'd like. After a few weeks I ended up mostly staging which is moving the wrapped pallets to the outbound dock where they will be put on trucks.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"For us the target rate is between 140 and 150 an hour but anything over 100 is going to keep you good with most managers at our site. If you're just beginning, the first few weeks you are not going to be reprimanded for having a ""bad"" rate. For staging, you move them to the dock area and they also have some people move pallets between trucks. You'd be doing one or the other but not both. If a process assistant or ambassador grabs you to do a task let them know you haven't done it before and say you want to learn how to do it. That way they can give you a run down of how to do it. At my site they have a sheet of where everything is supposed to go which logistics is happy to give people copies of to have on hand.  There's a shortage of stagers and cross dock people at my site so I very rarely stay on a sort line for longer than half an hour.  I've also been straight up assigned to stage on the sheet where you see what you're to do that shift.  If you consistently help push packages down the line to keep it going instead of just grabbing small packages and talking, managers will eventually notice it. Make yourself an asset to your line when you scan.

comment,AmazonFC,1,Scan rate is just a way to make sure people arent running off and doing nothing while on the clock and a way to make some goals or a little competition out of what is a very very repetitive job.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Thats not how it works. Managers like to say they give people they can depend on the opportunity to learn amnesty, but it is usually the people who are slightly above middle of the pack in rates. They are going to leave the best stowers on station to make their numbers look good.

Even then, Amnesty is just glorified KBS for the kiva floor that the building can track. 

It seems like you are trying to convince yourself that Amnesty is a dream job, but the best jobs in the building are the true indirect roles like IT, HR or Learning with no rates attached to them.

I was in pick for 8 months before getting into IT where I have been for the past year.

There has been no VTO since summer. The warehouse is at 108% capacity right now. He said they are stowing stuff everywhere imaginable, including offices. He's had to show several people how to create a location in the office, then stow the items there, LOL. New people are having a hard time because their rate seems low because they can't find anywhere to put things, then they try to ditch the cage in Problem Solve and take off, unless he can catch them and explain that he's there to fix things that won't scan properly or whatever, not just to take stuff they can't find a space to stash. It doesn't make sense to me why that warehouse is so over full, yet they keep getting more stuff and still have to work 55+ hours per week and other locations, like where you both are located, don't even have enough work for everyone.

You're likely looking at this continuing until after January 1, at least that's what they are being told right now, so you might get lucky and get back to normal, but don't count on it anytime soon!",0,t3_dwpgqs,t2_3zdeimpt,f7xvjbq,t3_dwpgqs,t5_1387r9,1574077380,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"We use the NetSpend card, same thing, they advertise ""up to 2 days faster"" and my husband's pay usually comes in around 10:50pm ET on Wednesday night of pay week. This past pay period had a holiday (Veterans Day) that closed banks the Monday of that week and the money came on the card Thursday morning at 6:30am. He has $500 of each pay put into our PayPal account because I have three teenage sons who live in the next state over with their dad during the school year and we can send money from our PayPal account to their PayPal account for free, so we keep money in there always. That portion always comes on Friday morning, usually around 2-3am, but has been as late as 7am.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"My husband has been working the same 55 hours in problem solve since early October and they have been told it will continue until January. He says he hates the extra hour, but definitely doesn't want to work 6x10 because that's just not enough time to catch up on sleep and get anything else done at all. He usually sleeps the first 24-30 hours straight when he gets home on Saturday morning. Then Sunday evening he does anything else that needs done, then we go back to sleep until 4:30pm Monday!!! During the work week, he does nothing but work and sleep. He has a 25 minute drive each way. He barely even eats. He wakes up at 4:30pm and leaves here at 5:25pm, gets home around 6:15am and goes straight to bed. I keep the same schedule as him because I don't work outside the home, but this time is rough for me because I literally do EVERYTHING for him so he can sleep. Get gas in the car, check the tires, run errands, change the oil, cook, clean, you name it, I can do it! He can't wait for the 40 hour, 4x10 weeks again so he can get back to spending three days catching up on sleep!",0,t1_f751yje,t2_3zdeimpt,f7xwy57,t3_dub3el,t5_1387r9,1574079060,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It's always slow the week or two right before Thanksgiving. Peak for inbound is over until outbound goes into peak next week. Can't bring in more product until space is made as most sites are way over capacity right now. Not to mention way over headcount for the workload. 

As for VTO, that's completely voluntary. If they don't have the workload for the headcount, they'll offer VTO. Don't want to take it? Then don't take it.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Can you actually name a single entry-level job that isn't bitch-tier work? Is flipping burgers and McDonalds better? Standing at a cash register at Walmart any better? 

I always find it strange that people have some sort of expectation that a) an entry level job won't suck and that b) working in a warehouse isn't going to be 'grueling' work. 

The difference between Amazon and every single other company you could think of is the upward potential. As T1 you have the opportunity to promote within Amazon and technically go wherever you'd like. There are positions that would normally take degrees that you will have the opportunity to apply for, and potentially cross-train in other departments with other teams that also require degrees or extensive experience in that field. 

Working at Amazon can suck, I know that all too well, but there is far more opportunity here for people to promote and have a fulfilling life that don't want to sit in a desk for the next four years to get some meme degree for a superficial headstart in their ""career.""",0,t1_f82c02e,t2_11p1ke,f82ikil,t3_dymwxk,t5_1387r9,1574191940,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Pros: good pay. Fantastic benefits, looks great on a resume later.

Cons: poor work life balance, a fair bit of your pay is tied up in stock, some facilities are better than others for new AMs, you are coming in at the worst possible time.

You will be working 4 12 hour shifts mostly, 1 hour pre-shift, 10 hour shift, 1 hour post shift. If you are going into a Fulfillment Center you can expect to have a team under you of somewhere between 60 - 140 associates depending on the management model being used at that site.

Peak (now until Christmas) is our busy time and you can expect to work 5 14 hour shifts per week.

If your department or site is doing poorly you may be required to put in extra time at home taking phone calls and classes.

Unless we are launching a new site and you are volun-told to go support there is little travel required.

An AMs first and primary job is to manage headcount to hit production targets. Most AMs fail because of poor time management and multitasking skills. You will be standing and walking for most of your shift. If you dont mind walking 11 miles a day and enjoy creating order out of chaos an AM role is the job for you.",0,t3_dyemha,t2_o3j7j,f82odbz,t3_dyemha,t5_1387r9,1574195105,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I'm similar to your personality, but you generally won't get any feedback except from those above you who are the type of person to offer praise/show admiration.  My experience is they make up a fraction like 1/8 or so of the managers I've encountered.  The rest are generally aware of what a good/hard worker you are though because I think they have meetings and discuss who to train more or 'rely' on for things etc while they probably also talk about who to hover over and who needs to be reigned in because they aren't performing as well etc.
  
Some of the PA's are there to just work behind the scenes and not necessarily deal with you unless you go to them for assistance.  Other PA's stick their head in your face trying to help or just bark out instructions to go there or do that and so on.  It could be because they know you are a good worker and can help balance out less impressive workers it could be they just need another body over there.  
  
I can only offer you the advice try to not let it bother you, if you are messing up they'll speak to you.  When you don't know something or are unsure of what to do go ask a PA/manager or other more experienced employee what you can do to help etc.  In time you'll know more of what to do when things are slow.",0,t3_dyltv0,t2_39reeprt,f82sifd,t3_dyltv0,t5_1387r9,1574197361,URL not found

I was inclined for 4 different positions after interviewing and nothing panned out so I looked elsewhere.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If you had been inclined four separate times and you didn't do anything with your inclined status, I would say you were not looking as far and wide as you probably believed you were (you need to apply for multiple other positions; T3 is barely above entry level for many positions and they don't require real experience). Simply applying for positions is only half the battle, less than half really. You need to network with people. There is a difference between 'playing favorites' and being someone who is revered by their manager/management.

I'm not trying to sound rude, i'm just telling you exactly how it is with interviews and getting the promotion over someone else. 

If you didn't really want that position and you were unhappy with yourself, people will notice, and people will talk that know you, and word will get around in the loops when they debrief and go over all of the candidates. The quality of your stories and what you provide the interviewer is just as important as the networking factor. 

Moving up in Amazon is easy if you do everything right, it really is, but people think it's more difficult due to experiences such as yours. If people don't put in the effort and simply think being inclined and doing a 'decent' job on the interview puts them above others, they have a lot to learn. When I was T1 I had already done projects, completed tasks, and given more privileges most T3's have never experienced and will never experience, simply because I asked and was relied upon by my L6, now i've landed in the big leagues in AWS- all of that translated into my interview. 

tl;dr - it really is that simple if you put in the work and expand your search beyond just your local FC. There is a great deal that one can do to put themselves above the rest.",0,t1_f82stio,t2_11p1ke,f82wlwh,t3_dymwxk,t5_1387r9,1574199630,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"here’s the thing amazon hires us to move boxes p.s or ambassador are called indirect roles as in roles not necessarily primary/direct to the function of moving those boxes so those roles are very limited and specially chosen. surely if you’ve never worked in a warehouse or have common sense you’re not gonna want to do work and just ask to ps but. it doesn’t work like that because you’ll have 100’s asking to problem solve and no one will move those boxes. then the shift fails. so they’re not gonna just take everyone! NOW those they do choose work in two different ways. ideally it should be the hardest worker who’s been working for a while and has some basic understanding of the process and can apply it to ps issues. BUT a lot of the time it doesn’t always or primarily work like that. it comes down to seen who is the main problem
solver and who the manager likes. if you can get along with both of those you are usually at better odds at getting a spot in at ps. atleast the last 10-15 people i’ve seen try it about 10 were friends of one or the other. most people just get rejected because well you’re not cool with them. so i just rather do another easy task or role rather than stow. like diverting the boxes or picking them to their buffer or even maintenance work. and in my spare time i’ll bullshit the psolvers to make friends although they are usually a stuck up bunch and primarily only talk to ambassador or other higher ups! so goodluck",0,t1_f7oodvh,t2_n5g5m,f8489i6,t3_dx54il,t5_1387r9,1574235069,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,I hear ya. I'm in the same boat. But the secret to moving up at amazon without a degree is to change locations. It's far easier to get jobs further up in Amazon if you aren't afraid of leaving the building you know. Also leave the FC entirely. AMZL is far more fast paced for progression. Mostly cause there aren't 100+ people in your own building who get inclined for the same roles.,0,t1_f84i3bu,t2_23luoa5y,f84ijne,t3_dxt784,t5_1387r9,1574250210,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Yes, I was Tier 1 at one point; i'm not going to reveal where i'm at now or my level, i'm simply explaining to you my experience and observations over the years. Sorry if you feel like i'm flat out telling you ""no"" or disagree with your opinion on those who get promotions and how they get them, i'm not disagreeing with you on that point at all. What I am disagreeing with you on (and this is where my assumption comes into play) is the difficulty of getting promoted. If all you know is your own FC, then yes, it can be very difficult if your leadership is utter garbage (I experienced it as well, and it's the sole reason my former FC is one of the worse performing in the entire network). This is why I said everyone in Amazon needs to expand their view far beyond the norm, like myself. Instead of remaining in the mindset of ""FC, FC, FC,"" I looked at AWS; low and behold I actually ended up here. 


Getting back to the point of things.

I make that assumption because I know people who were excellent Tier 1's or Tier 3's wanting to promote into Operations. However, each of them that went through multiple loops and failed 3+ times never took the interview feedback to heart and acted on it; I had fundamental disagreements with these people, and now that i've seen how these processes work on the back end, I would side with Amazon more times than not; this doesn't mean i'm dismissing the fact you might get completely screwed for the ""diversity"" quota or someone playing favorites, but i'm making my assumption based on the most common factor, and that is that people are lacking exceedingly in a certain area that causes them to be inclined, but not slotted for the role. 


I have one very good friend at Amazon that still works in the FC as a T3 and he is always on the away team; he is constantly being offered positions by people he meets. Why? Because out of everyone I met he is actually probably the best T3 anyone will ever meet, he is in a league on his own in terms of technical skill and understanding of how certain Amazon systems work. Because of that, yes, when people meet him they do make him offers. In some cases 'favoritism' is not always a bad thing if it means you are being acknowledged for your efforts, but it takes a lot to stand out.",0,t1_f839bwo,t2_11p1ke,f84s9r2,t3_dymwxk,t5_1387r9,1574259432,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I don't disagree with you, there were plenty of utterly shit T1's that got promoted and if I had any say in it, I would have rejected them on the spot. I definitely sympathize with you, but it is always a mixed bag. I have friends that are probably the best T3's in the entire damn FC network that have been propositioned by several people when they leave on the away-team; on the flip side, I know several who absolutely never deserved it, like the people you mention.

Trust me when I say that each FC will have very good, and utterly horrid leaders. As long as you can find a way to rub shoulders with those who would acknowledge your hard work, they will (or at least should as Operations) seek to advance you throughout Amazon. I've been on the receiving end of both situations; it really does suck, but I will never tell someone it is impossible or that it won't ever happen.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"What I hear is you're blaming the lack of medicine on why you can't get to work on time. I'm intrigued to know more about why you can't adjust your sleep schedule to accommodate your need to be at work. Yes, adjust your schedule to deal with the pain of withdrawal and the physical pain of what is out of sync in your body.  


Your points are not the issue. This ""I'll do better when it matters"" thing does. Assume you're at 4 points from now on and get it together. Whatever meds you are on can be prescribed by another doctor as long as they are legitimate and not in improper controlled substance amounts. Yeah, I'm assuming it's the Schedule II case going on right now. Yes, it's going to be hard to get that Rx refilled for quite some time, even an ER visit won't guarantee anything more than Tramadol - if that.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You need to give more information.  I'm presuming you're talking about stow because I do pick and a rate of 200 is quite slow for us...

&amp;nbsp;

My 2 cents: don't worry about your rate.  Literally do not worry about it at all until you get a verbal or written warning from a manager.  Work at an easy pace that you are comfortable with.  Problem solvers, PAs and managers will pressure you to hit a certain rate because that's their job.

I don't think you will be fired immediately for using UPT for 3 days consecutively, but they will consider it job abandonment and will review you for termination.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"i hear you, but there's 3 things:

1. if you're really getting that much oversize material, you'll still have to put it at the end of the aisles once the oversize racks are completely full. 

2. think of all the additional time it will take to clear off the buffer rakcs. you'll start to congest the entire building and flowrate will slow down and sort will have to process lower amounts of volume. i'm not here to make a defense for the expected workrate being what it is, but rather to tell you that management is unlikely to make a process change that will decrease productivity rates with absolute certainty.

3. /u/Internetguy9998 already made [this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/dzzfkv/opinions_for_stowers_in_delivery_stations/f8bqfhg/) but it's a great point. as a line leader, i'll occasionally defuse an overloaded buffer rack by pulling oversize materials off onto another rack and wheeling it behind the aisles to have my stowers quickly scan them in and get back to clearing the buffer rack while i stow the large stuff away. doing this also helps at the very end of the night after induct is finished and we're working on scanning a handful of outstanding aisles, especially when there are 2 or 3 people in that aisle trying to get everything done as fast as possible.",0,t1_f8ezcxp,t2_2k7n57sv,f8fa4u0,t3_dzzfkv,t5_1387r9,1574540542,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Keep you head down and just keep pushing forward. 5 weeks from now things will start to get better. To use the Amazon leadership principals, Be Curious, Dive deep and Think Big! Observe everything going on around you while you work and ask questions about what you're seeing, then find the answers. Invent and simplify, no one knows how to do your job better than you. If you can think of a way to do your job faster/easier do it (of course make sure your not violating any safety policies). If you can prove it works tell your manager about it and show them. Earn Trust and deliver results, keep your rate up, your errors low, minimize your time off task and show flexibility. You might not be able to earn your direct manager or PAs trust, so it's worth your time to get to know the Ops managers and Sr Ops managers as well.

Remember, company policy is strictly anti-union, management gets regular training on recognizing pro union talk like ""living wage"" and ""stewardship"".

comment,AmazonFC,3,"Management will never like unions, and this guy managed ""grocery stores."" Of course he will say that about unions.  Just look at Danish companies and how they set up pay and benefits.  They have a middle man, that negotiates for them.  Amazon does not want that, because it strips them of that power and their cost will go up.  I always laugh at the anti union talk.  I use Denmark as an example because all my Danish friends negotiate their pay after tax, have up to 30-60 days of vacation, friendly leaves, full pay for both parents if they have a child.  The list goes on an on.  And while they have no minimum wage, the middle man (the union) always gets them a dam good deal.  I will also quote my friend, as we walked through Copenhagen and saw a Mc Donald's sign up saying they are hiring ""You see that there, they're hiring at Mc Donald's.  The workers who work their will have good pay that will be sufficient to live on their own within Copenhagen.""",0,t1_f8hu6rg,t2_4y71do3e,f8mafxh,t3_e0ouqe,t5_1387r9,1574629636,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"&gt;The horror reviews mostly seem to be coming from particular FCs with bad management or workers who thought warehouse work wasn't supposed to be very strenuous or something.

Some weeks ago, there was someone in this subreddit who tried hard to make me feel ashamed because I don't hate Amazon. It has its flaws like any job, but any complaint I've ever had is management-related. The job itself does not bother me at all. This person (and their friends, they claim) hated the company, however.

Of course, no one can have a good experience and since they and their friends had bad ones. /s

Funny thing is I came after hearing about it from some of my own friends who worked for Amazon. While it certainly wasn't a career choice for any of them, the worst they had to say was it's tiring and more stressful than retail. None of them had horror stories.

Amazon as a company is certainly no saint, but like any workplace, your FC depends on what the management is like. And of course, there are always those people who don't expect it to be hard.",0,t1_f8nl36f,t2_pc76k,f8nwgs2,t3_e180jp,t5_1387r9,1574654761,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"So explaining a temporary PA role, I would suggest including that on his resume as a PG (Process Guide) and just add that he was the acting PA while being the PG. Also reaching out to former AM or current AM for any help on this front, I would definitely recommend that. Knowledge is power!
Also try to tailor his resume to the PA spot instead sounding like a very good associate. The goal, both on the resume and in the interview, would be to sound like he is an overworked and underpaid PA than an over preforming and hard working associate. Because in the eyes of the reader/interviewer, why would they need to promote a very good associate? 
The STAR method is imperative in the interview. Know it. Like it will make or break the interview. There are a lot of resources for Amazon interviews on inside.amazon.com. 
Also any sort of numbers to help back up stories are very helpful but not super important. Makes you sound better if you do though.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I'm gauging how much information I can give you without you dismissing it ""corporate astroturfing"" like other posters are complaining. 

1. Associates set the rates; obviously this is somewhat of a half-truth, Amazon knows what their output needs to be (the building itself has a planned output based on its blueprint), but it ultimately comes down to associate performance. This doesn't mean that they won't artificially set and increase the rates to encourage increased physical exertion, but this doesn't mean that they will set unrealistic expectations if there are barriers affecting building performance.

2. I agree, management by and large is utterly horrid, but what do you really expect? L4, an AM, is an entry level position for many people. The longer you're at Amazon, the more you start to realize that most AM's are college hires with no real life or work experience; many people do not possess leadership traits you and I would want to see. School cannot teach you character.

3. You, and many other people, have a very, VERY unrealistic expectation of what Amazon FC work is like. You are working in a warehouse, I don't know how else to put it for you and others who complain about the physical labor. The site I came from had a pack-singles rate of 60, and the highest I had done was 153; the difference between me and Jim Bob hitting barely 70? Jim Bob is not *literally* sweating, among many other personal differences. Physical labor is not easy. Would you walk onto a construction site and begin complaining about their physical expectations of you? Should a construction site build their business to accommodate for every new hire with a different need?


In reality it all boils down to more or less what i've listed above. The FC is labor intensive, I don't know why people don't think this is what the job is going to entail. However, it is not all doom and gloom and you can make a positive impact. If you see how something can be improved, you should be bringing this up with your AM. If your AM doesn't listen, bring it up with your OM, if they don't listen, heck, schedule a meeting with your site leader, that's what I did in the past, I said screw this i'm going to someone with the power to actually make changes. As much as the buildings are designed for efficiency, they are still made by humans and humans are not perfect. Likewise, neither will be all the other parts (and people) that go along with the FC.

I can sympathize with you on many levels, but at the same time I cannot. You can make a difference, as cliche as that sounds I know it to be a matter of fact. On that note, I will also never support unionization either. Unions are a cancer that increase cost for everyone.",0,t3_e0ouqe,t2_11p1ke,f8owrrg,t3_e0ouqe,t5_1387r9,1574691659,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I don't agree with what the other poster has said; attempting to convey what you view as ""overworked"" and ""underpaid"" could be seen in a negative light by many people. 

What your husband needs to start doing ASAP is constructing at least 5 stories to fit the STAR format. Unless he's naturally talented at communicating his points in an interview, he needs to do mock interviews. He needs to ask his manager for the interview packet (whatever you might refer to it as, it's a packet that actually has all the questions the interviewer asks; it's nothing secret, but upon request they will provide it) and he needs to go over those questions to get an idea of what he will encounter. There are many, too many to plan for all of them, so this is why his stories need to be exceptional with many dynamics. 

If your stories don't possess many different elements, you're going to struggle against other applicants and it'll just come down to sheer dumb luck in the end. 

If he has done PS, IOL and has varying permissions that most normal PS associates don't have, he should have many more stories to draw from than the normal associate, or even most T3's. When he is recalling these stories, he needs to write them out and be prepared to tell these stories *in great detail.* When the interviewers debrief and go over the applicants, you want to ensure they have a lot to talk about. 

In my opinion, the biggest mistake people make is the biggest cliche- not being prepared enough. If you mention DeleteItemsApp and don't further explain to me what that tool is and its implications in FC related work, i'm going to be disappointed. Likewise, whatever tools he uses, whatever power he has been given, he needs to be explaining these things in detail in a way that is understandable to people who might have no clue what he's talking about.


Get those stories down. Do mock interviews if you must. Continue to polish your stories with key details covering data (if he has it; it's Amazon ""muh data"" is a meme at this point, but that's all some of these bums interviewing will care about) and character (don't tailor your stories to make yourself sound like you're vying for sympathy ""i'm overworked""). 


Detailed stories; data if you have it; exemplifying your character",0,t3_e1gg68,t2_11p1ke,f8pg168,t3_e1gg68,t5_1387r9,1574700940,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"implying that people don’t like working at amazon because they don’t want to be held accountable, or don’t act like “real adults” is p inaccurate imo.

the FC’s near where i live are horrible, with garbage management constantly threatening and firing people left and right, not giving full breaks, running like temp agencies, not compensating people during their time off after being injured at work. people have received random, mysterious write-ups when they apply to transfer departments bc the one i was in was trash w ridiculously high turnover. whenever i’d have to freaking PEE i’d have a PA bitching at me over my takt time, like i’m sorry it takes 5 minutes just to walk TO the bathroom? as if that’s my fault? am i supposed to just hold it? piss on the floor?? 60 hour work weeks with my body breaking down bc of 12 hours of intense fucking labor is insane. 

i know some people so terrified of losing their jobs they’ve tried skipping their breaks and are overexerting themselves beyond what’s reasonable, even for a warehouse, for fucking $15/hr. it’s disgusting and impossible to feel dignified where i worked, management sure as hell never failed to let us know how disposable and replaceable we are 🙃🙃🙃

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Thank you so much for taking the time to write all of that! I sent him screenshots so he can read over everything you said as well as four pages worth of screenshots and examples and links to two sites that explain the STAR interview method. My husband and I talk all the time during his breaks, as well as during his 30 minute drive each way to and from work and he tells me different stories about what he's doing, how his night is going, etc and since I don't work there, he has to explain to me how/why he's doing something a certain way, so I think just the day to day of explaining things to me, not just what he's doing, but how, why, etc, has actually probably been pretty him for giving those examples. If I tell him to tell them the story basically like he would tell it to me, then he will already be doing better than a lot of people at explaining the various ins and outs of the different types of things that he does each night. I think I will look back through my old texts and emails as well to jog my memory about different things he has told me about, then I will make him some notes about what I remember, as well as leave him space to fill in details so he can pick the five best and really practice them. I just told him that during the interview, he probably shouldn't start most of the stories with ""Babe, you're not going to believe what this dumb ass idiot just did/said..."" Or ""I don't know what ass hole did this last shift, but you're not going to believe how bad they fucked this up!..."" LOL. But in doing that, he has actually been sort of preparing without even realizing or trying. He is really great at showing other people how to do things and he is a fast worker and pretty much everyone really likes him, even though they don't get along with pretty much anyone else on the shift, people really are drawn to him and he always tries to help and explain things. Before my husband started working at Amazon, he was a mechanic and I was the receptionist, so I am also aware of little flaws that he has that he needs to work on (or how to answer that question ""what's something that you need to work on so that you can better do your job?)""... He's sometimes faster paced than a lot of people, and if he is extremely busy and overwhelmed, sometimes he tries to just get everything done by himself rather than have to be bothered by someone trying to help who may slow him down by asking questions. He's well known by management for being able to get his job done with absolutely no need to check up on him to make sure he is working, etc.  If he does by some miracle (not this time of year, but sometimes in the spring/summer) he runs out of IOL or Problem Solve is slow, he'll build some cages or a couple of weeks ago he organized a whole area where a bunch of pass through stuff was just piled up because it needed fixed by problem solve, but was huge, heavy items all the way on the other side of the warehouse, so he grabbed a computer and scanner and totally got that whole area organized and items put away neat and he opened up a bunch of space where more stuff could be stowed, which was really helpful since they are way over capacity right now. I'm going to let him know to really start thinking twice those examples and start taking little notes at the end of the day so he can remember important things that happened in detail.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Thank you very much! I'm also sending him a screenshot of your reply so that he can look over it as well as the stuff I found and sent to him explaining the STAR method. I think he is going to reach out to the former AM who transferred to Florida, that's the person who first realized his potential and started giving him more responsibility after only about eight months, by his year mark, he was halfway through the time he filled in for the PA. He doesn't know the new AM very well, and he's a little cautious to tell many people that he is applying for this because he is actually a little worried that someone might actually try to prevent him from going because he is the only person on his shift who does IOL, one of only three who can do Problem Solve and he has quite a few permissions that the current PA does not have and has asked for and still hasn't gotten for some reason. Things that former AM showed him how to do to make things neater, more efficient and just overall faster that no one else has any idea can be done, let alone have any idea of how to actually do certain things (I know that he can do something about creating virtual bins that temporarily hold a bunch of items so you can fix them all at once rather than one at a time, that's just one example he gave me of something that former AM showed him and one other person, and that guy recently transferred to the new large items warehouse, also not far from where he works now, so that just leaves my husband to do IOL, certain things in Problem Solve that right now, they just stack stuff up while he's doing IOL and he runs back and forth between the two all night, whenever the Problem Solve person gets too far behind or too much piled up they don't know how to or aren't allowed to fix, he will stop doing IOL and catch up PS and go back to IOL. But he's afraid that if they find out he's thinking of leaving, they may try to prevent it from happening, so he's just not telling anyone.",0,t1_f8owem3,t2_3zdeimpt,f8pwyl0,t3_e1gg68,t5_1387r9,1574708599,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Exactly, I told him to basically explain it during the interview like he explains it to me. Like a few days ago he used this one trick the former AM showed him to create a virtual bin and put everything in there, then edit it (it was blankets that receive had entered all as red or some shit and really like 100 of them were blue), so he was able to do it using that method and fix all 100 at one time and send it straight back out to be stowed, whereas the other Problem Solve person was trying to fix all 100 blankets one at a time while more and more stuff is getting dropped off and problem solve is backed up to the wall...I told him to explain it to me in detail then I wrote notes about it in the little notebook with the resume and cover letter stuff I'm finishing up for him, so there's one of his scenerios, and I followed your advice and made sure it was clear what happened (there were 200 weighted blankets received, all had tags from receive indicating that they were red, when in fact approximately 100 were blue, so rather than fix them one at a time, he used (I wrote down the exact steps he told me), which is a method he learned from (former AM), and by doing it that way, he was able to fix them much faster so that they could be sent back out to be stowed and Problem Solve wouldn't continue to get further backed up. He even explained that you have to have a certain permission in order to do that and that he has it and what else that can be used for sometimes (IOL stuff), etc. I felt like it covered each part of the STAR method very well, and I felt like I understand what he did and why, so they definitely will too...I really think he would be great for the job as well, he's tends to get bored easily just stowing or tugging, so at least now he's got IOL and Problem Solve, but I think the PA job will keep him busy with a variety of different things and he will like it even more. When he filled in for the 6 weeks, he never once had a single problem, he went in early, set up the labor board, moved people around throughout the night as necessary, etc. The only thing is, he works in a warehouse right now and the place he is applying for the PA position in is one of the places where the Amazon Vans are loaded up for one day/same day deliveries, so I'm sure there are some things there that will be new to him, but I'm sure he'll have it figured out in no time flat.",0,t1_f8q3jkw,t2_3zdeimpt,f8rwb1e,t3_e1gg68,t5_1387r9,1574756248,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"""Reporting,"" more like libel.

I saw those articles this morning and they are for the most part unsubstantiated and fabricated bull shit. Firstly, ""injury reports"" at FC's are a dime a dozen. Safety/Ops will complain about the fact that every damn time someone goes into AmCare they have to fill out incident reports, it's standard in what I assume is most FC's; these reports can range from irrelevantly minor to serious. To somehow claim this is evidence that Amazon is on par with some sort of labor camp that doesn't care about its employees is absolutely false. 

We had someone SCRATCH themselves on a zip-tie, and it was reported and recorded as an incident. 

That guy in the video is a mindless shill who knows absolutely nothing and has probably never stepped foot in an FC; I would love to debate this guy on the merits of his claims and ""data"" and demolish him on live TV. Amazon takes safety extremely serious, this isn't to say incidents never happen despite training and safeguards, but i'm not going to side with some random who think 15 ""serious"" incidents out of 100 associates (which are absolutely more than likely self-inflicted for not following standard work) is out of the norm for work in a fast paced warehouse environment. 

These articles are exhaustively long and i'm not going to waste my time going through that monstrosity, but from the few things i've seen them claim it is complete and total unsubstantiated nonsense, and I genuinely hope Amazon sues those news outlets into oblivion for libel.",0,t3_e20fpv,t2_11p1ke,f8ssoh1,t3_e20fpv,t5_1387r9,1574788256,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I was T1 like the rest of you at one point, feel free to feed me your constant lies about how rate is so hard to hit while you goof off with your friends and come back late from break every time. 

""Amazon only cares about avoiding liability! Corporate shill!""

This is why you have safety training for virtually every single area of Amazon. If you're about to tell me that Amazon somehow *doesn't* care about potential incidents that will land the company in hot water, you are operating on fewer brain cells than I had assumed. I really shouldn't have to spend any time whatsoever pointing this out, since you go through multiple power-points on safety and other topics on your first day. 

Under reported? Really, is that so. Did you think I was joking about someone scratching themselves and it being reported? If I could paste the ticket here I more than gladly would. Incidents are far from under-reported, if anything I would even argue Amazon overreacts when there is an incident. There's a reason why tape guns are not the norm in FC's, even though they would be far more efficient. Do you want to know why we don't use them as a standard? Because hilariously we've had ""injuries"" before (not really injuries, it was just people using them improperly and actually complained about being pricked by the serrated 'blade' to cut the tape) and Safety deemed them ""unsafe."" The only time you will find tape guns is solely for the sake of business need- ie: special handling sites or places that have BoD.

 I could go on and on and on about how mindlessly ridiculous the reports are, from the quantity and quality of the reports and how blatantly obvious they are when it is due to someone not following the rules and doing things their own way. Want to lift that 40 lb bag of dog food without bending at the knees like 90% of people do? Don't complain when you throw your back out. But yes, that kind of stuff is *totally* Amazon's fault for not holding your hand enough.

This may come as a surprise, but i'm actually completely on your side and I will **gladly** bring down the hammer in any instance where Amazon is in the wrong. On the flip side, I will **gladly** bring down the hammer on ungrateful associates who do not follow the rules and guidelines designed to keep them safe. To believe these rules do not have a duality - to shield you *and* the company - is naive.",0,t1_f8t9t7k,t2_11p1ke,f8teq77,t3_e20fpv,t5_1387r9,1574801830,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Sure, easy, the highest I ever achieved was 240% to productivity in a direct role. What I would tell every person is to use good judgement. Not everything part of ""standard work"" involves safety; how you unfold a box and the order that you perform packing an item doesn't need to be followed to the letter for those who find a more efficient way of doing things.

Example: standard work dictates one item on the desk at a time while packing

Did I do this? No. Depending on what the items were, I would take multiple like-items, place them on the desk, take sp00's and put them on my arm, and take out the corresponding number of boxes. Does this follow SoP? No, not at all, but it isn't really going to result in me hurting myself either. Was I able to maintain quality and rate? Yes to both, while exceeding rate. 

The point is there are very obvious decisions you are going to make that lead to injuries, no matter what you do. Lifting with your back is going to lead to back problems, not team-lifting an item that you *probably shouldn't have attempted to lift solo* is going to bite you in the ass later too. 

Good judgement, this is something important that is severely lacking.",0,t1_f8tdi35,t2_11p1ke,f8tfe2u,t3_e20fpv,t5_1387r9,1574802226,URL not found

Is a report that leaves out key details about deaths such as: all FC's have contracted maintenance workers for PIT equipment and the guy who was working on them wasn't such a person, and neglected his own safety by not using a support that was provided to actually quite literally prevent the kind of accident that occurred.

I was T1 at one point, but whether I am or was is not a qualifying factor for who is supposedly allowed to disagree with the hive-mind of anti-amazon shills.",0,t1_f8uihxi,t2_11p1ke,f8v5r5y,t3_e20fpv,t5_1387r9,1574860419,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I wouldn't get your hopes up. I have yet to see someone skip levels from T1 to L4. The only instances where I have seen people be given the opportunity to skip are people I know with a Masters that interviewed for Sr. Ops positions, and that was once. If you don't have a relationship with your site leader (assuming the position is posted for your building) or the other Sr. Ops, and you aren't exceptionally qualified, your chances of skipping levels are slim to none. 

What I suggest you do is request to have a 1-on-1 with your site leader (anyone can do this, simply speak to HR to set it up). If you are as proficient as you allude to, and you're a competent individual that can exemplify the leadership traits, you may or may not gain the support of your site leader and hopefully wouldn't receive push-back. The only real way to find out is by applying. 

Also, what you could do is request a print-out of the Amazon general level guidelines. Compare what you have done in your professional life to what is expected of an L4. Perhaps even ask your site leader what is expected and lay out who you are for them. 

tl;dr - you aren't going to be given preferential/special treatment (as in being allowed to skip T3 and go to L4) if you don't have the support of your AM, and most or more likely your site leader; you can do this by showing them you have already performed at the level of competency and technicality of an L4. If they don't want to advance you and stick to the normal process of promoting people from T1 - T3 - L4, you have absolutely no chance of getting that position.",0,t3_e2fjh1,t2_11p1ke,f8vjxpi,t3_e2fjh1,t5_1387r9,1574871136,URL not found

Feel free to communicate this message to your employer: he could not defend the merits of his article if I or ANYONE who takes a reasonable stance on everything occurring at Amazon from a safety standpoint. 

I know for a 100% fact he has not ""investigated"" an FC, because they would not give him access.

I know for a 100% fact he is knowingly libeling Amazon because he has some fetish-tier vendetta against them, because no real ""investigative reporter"" would look at high level incidents and fail to actually investigate every single possible area needed to draw a conclusion- missing the enormous factoid that Amazon does not use normal FC associates to maintain equipment, that is not Amazon policy and goes against the policy for blatantly obvious safety reasons.",0,t1_f8vkx4k,t2_11p1ke,f8vlj8q,t3_e20fpv,t5_1387r9,1574872157,URL not found

Even if you aren't confident in your skill, I wouldn't say talking to your senior leadership is a bad thing. Talking to them builds rapport and you will have better insight into what your own leadership is looking for when they want to promote people.

There is absolutely no harm in having a 1-on-1 with anyone in senior leadership, if anything it's something that they themselves would probably encourage and welcome for many different reasons.",0,t1_f8vqrik,t2_11p1ke,f8vuw9c,t3_e2fjh1,t5_1387r9,1574877741,URL not found

But as far as going from a tier 1 to 4, it is hard, if not impossible like others have said. I graduated this year with a bachelors when I was a tier 1, immediately I got disqualified from any tier 4 I applied to. It’s one of those unwritten rules I feel like. I think if you have the experience it shouldn’t matter what tier you jump to, but that’s just the reality of it.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I’ve worked at both before. FC during peak last year as seasonal (ended up letting me go) and a DS this year for about the last 6 months. Delivery stations are most definitely laid back a bit more (phones are aloud inside, music playing, less strict about the rates and safety). I’d say it’s way too laid back, to a fault for sure, but that’s just my input. 

The FC was a bit stricter, but also felt like the people I worked with cared about the job / reaching our goal much more than those I work with at the DS. Part of that probably has to do with the full time, health benefits and other full/reduced time only perks (like PTO/vacation). Most people at the DS are part time with the exception of shift assistants and other similar leadership - but our benefits only include UPT, dental and vision. 

This is just my personal experience at the facilities I’ve worked at, I’m sure others have different experiences from different facilities, but I’m trying to climb the ladder a bit at Amazon. Overall, I enjoy working here and I feel lucky to have a job (and have been converted to a blue badge). Not everyone is as lucky. At a certain point, a lot of people complain just to hear themselves talk or they just enjoy complaining.",0,t3_e29xyx,t2_o9v3g,f8xupa9,t3_e29xyx,t5_1387r9,1574935400,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Also work a 4 hours shift

Use a tennis ball to message them during your break. It usually helps for an hour or so. Otherwise just go to the bathroom and rub your feet.

I've also bought some orange superfeet insole but I've stopped using them once i got the Bondi 6.

The Bondi 6 helped immensely, go with plush instead of balance cushioning, though the mesh kinda rubs my right toe and gets uncomfortable but not painful. 

I tried the a Sketchers Max Cushion shoe and they feel comparable to a bondi, but I don't have any experience with them, but they only have regular and extra wide width while bondi also have wide width. I would call a store to see if they have some, and the coupon does not work with them.

I would exchange the Clifton for Bond 6 or other plush Hoka or a Sketchers max cushioning shoe. Try them out at a physical store before buying them to make sure their your size.

The things I tried but didn't work was kinesio/medical tape and heel the pain inserts (too painful).",0,t3_e38clz,t2_ehb64,f91w9nj,t3_e38clz,t5_1387r9,1575003323,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Thanks for the comments regarding this.  The reason I asked is because during stand up, my manager made a point that everyone needs to go the station assigned to them and not deviate from it because our stations are assigned to us based on our numbers (rate) which is used to determine where we should be assigned. 

With that being said, packers who have a high rate are placed with the inductees and rebinners who put out work at a fast pace.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"This is a pretty serious rant. I'm currently at CLE3 as my 3rd FC and all I have to say about the no opportunities is that in my last building that was around for 5 years there have been people struggling to get promoted for over 3 years with no luck meanwhile people are getting promoted at CLE3 in less then a month or hired from outside as a tier 3 which was non existent in my old building. If your at CLE3 that means you have only been at Amazon for 2 months max.

I don't know any other job where people can and do move up this quickly and make this kind of money with no experience or degrees.

This all being said I don't think I will be doing a launch again. It has been an absolute disaster with new hires tier 1 all the way up to operations having no idea what is going on at a time when we need experienced people the most. Meanwhile those new hires act like they know everything and refuse to listen to things you tell them.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I currently work at CLE3 as an inbound stow associate, and I'm frankly amazed to see anyone else talking about this FC on reddit. I 100% agree with everything both of you have written. This launch has been ridiculous. I guess that's what happens when you open up the floor to ANYONE who can click a few buttons and make it to the new hire event. More than half the people who work here are stuck in high school games and ridiculous displays of how cool they think they are.

I have a college degree, am a productive employee, and am very good with computers and complex problems. I took this job because it was basically my only choice at the time after a very rough past three months. I was hoping to use this as an opportunity to advance, possibly into IT or quality assurance. But it seems like at CLE3 that being good at your job, and delivering upon expectations and then some, is not in any way how you advance. In fact, I feel like doing those things is setting me back!

It really sucks, because I legitimately can see that Amazon might be a good place for me... but I guess CLE3 is not the way. Thank you for sharing this, it is brilliantly written.",0,t3_e3l4b7,t2_4kqzv,f93s5sd,t3_e3l4b7,t5_1387r9,1575067094,URL not found

CDO/retail generates profit, and I don't think it's fair to say the cost centers of CDO (FCs/SCs/etc) aren't a component of that profit. CDO/retail as a whole is quite low margin due to our expansions, especially relative to AWS, but it could still be (barely this year) profitable on its own. Marketplace, for example, is steadily growing profit margins and relies on AMZL and FCs.

CDO (Consumer/Digital/Other) does not operate at a loss. CDO operates at a very low profit margin for a 'tech company', and the recent cost ballooning in consumer retail (due to 1 day shipping) is being offset somewhat by marketplace, but CDO maintains profitability in part due to FCs and logistics investments.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If that happened, Amazon stock value would be significantly lower until additional revenues from recent investments in expanding our logistics networks came in, which will be 1-2 years out. Margins could get thin enough to consider halting further growth into our NA CDO investments due to lack of market competitiveness, which is alarming and does not bode well for workers in the long term in my view, unless competitors also have their labor costs raised.

To break down the numbers, we have around 300,000 FC/logistics/etc workers making 15/hr or greater on full-time hours (some are seasonal, though full-time is expected to grow sharply as many of our new FC centers turn the lights on). North America's net operating income for Q3 was 1.3 billion(!), which demonstrates CDO is _still_ profitable in NA, despite seeing a nearly 40% plunge in operating income compared to the same time last year. In Q4, the decline in YOY income is expected to be anywhere from 25% to 70% as well.

To get back to the 300,000 number, if we increased minimum wage from 15/hr to 20/hr, we would see increases in cost at approximately $750 million per quarter ( (20-15) * (50/4) * 300,000 ). Doing that this quarter would make NA operating income level out to around $550 million, and when you combine that with CDO International's quarterly loss of $330 million, we end up with $220 million left in quarterly operating income for CDO. 

CDO would still be profitable! It'd have some of the thinnest margins of any company in the world operating at our size, and the absolute thinnest out of any tech or (successful) retail company in the US at our size, but in theory it wouldn't sink immediately. If the new costs were distributed correctly, you may not see the brunt of them show up in Q1/Q2 2020 which typically produce lower revenue than Q3/Q4, though in those early quarters we might even see negative operating income for CDO.

In practice, it would require us to focus on investment in automation, and allow competitors in retail stores to invest more back into their own eCommerce and logistics initiatives modeled after ours (except with comparatively lower pay for workers).

Would Bezos still be worth billions? Yes! Would CDO go under? Probably not, and especially not if we can rely on AWS. Could CDO be spun off as a separate company? Seems more plausible than the gossip of it we have nowadays if CDO negative operating incomes make AWS less competitive with other cloud providers.

Anyways, I suggest watching Brian Olsavsky's review of 2019 financials in the All-Hands to get a better idea of how Amazon is expecting to do in the next couple years, and you can decide on your own what might be a good minimum wage to raise things to.",0,t1_f94bdfb,t2_54fixzlj,f94wjy0,t3_e3olrv,t5_1387r9,1575107321,URL not found

Well, when I say CDO it does include the eCommerce side of the company which has a major stake in our logistics divisions. FCs/AMZL are an integral part of keeping CDO profitable by keeping our shipping goals independent of UPS/FedEx networks' bandwidths.

&gt;Robotics will continue to decrease headcount in AMZL/FCs but mostly eliminate associate level roles.

Robotics is a ways off from completely replacing human FCs, and we will likely always have a large human workforce in FCs. Automation will continue to grow its role in FCs, but don't expect major pushes to remove people en masse until it costs a LOT more to keep people employed relative to Target or Walmart.

Though you're right, as general career advice you should probably take advantage of things like career choice program or Pay to Quit program rather than becoming too complacent with FC work.",0,t1_f94vkxr,t2_54fixzlj,f94x6ej,t3_e3olrv,t5_1387r9,1575108308,URL not found

I am not the only one that noticed this.  Thank you for making it known.  The city of Rialto is aboutn 60%-70% hispanic, yet over 50% of management in the FC white.  Yes, there is some people of black and hispanic heritage in management, but those on the top seem to be as vanilla as can be.  Now I am under no circumstances saying that white people cannot have management positions, but when the leadership team does not reflect the community they are located in, you know there is some selective hiring going on.  I would expect a majority white management team in the mid west, because of demographics, but certainly not in California, especially in cities where there is a ratio of 2 minority people to 1 person of Caucasian decent.",0,t3_e3l4b7,t2_qodn9,f95xyov,t3_e3l4b7,t5_1387r9,1575136975,URL not found

There are opportunities to create a dashboard to show who is trained in what (Flex does a good job, and anyone can lookup logins in fclearning) and improve upon it, but I don't think that will make one eligible for an L6 position.

comment,AmazonFC,3,"I think you're in the wrong area then quite honestly. The type of position you're looking for isn't going to be localized for the building you're at. Also, I think you have a long way to go before you understand the complexity of the back-end software tools Amazon has. You're only stowing and haven't begun to realize just how broad the number of tools are.

The Learning department can track who has training and who doesn't. Everyone technically has access to the FC learning portal and each associates transcripts to see who has been trained in what. Whether or not what you think would lead to better efficiency and cost savings is kind of a moot point, because we have a much bigger ""problem"" on our hands. 

The problem? You're T1 and wanting to jump to L6; you have better chances of hell freezing over than making that jump. Certain roles start at specific levels, there is a leveling guideline for every team and role throughout Amazon and its subsidiaries. 


I think this is a complex problem that's going to require a bit more thought on your part since you're only 30 days in. I want to lay it all on you, but tenure is a problem as well. 

Extreme tl;dr version if I was in your shoes:

- Apply for T3 or L4 AM role (speak specifically to the recruiter or hiring manager since you already have a degree, the degree and *what* your experience was will weigh heavily on anyone's decision making) 

- Promote within a year (technically speaking we can promote quarterly... but... no one does that) after being promoted to T3/L4 to L4/L5, 

- Promote again to L6 within a year or less


As I said previously, leveling guidelines are different for all teams within Amazon, and depending on where you actually want to go (software development in Corporate? Continuing in the FC?) will dictate how long it takes you to get there. Once you're internal it's far more difficult, *much* more difficult. Why? Because you can get hired externally into an L6 role as opposed to starting from the very bottom and working your way up. Is it impossible? Absolutely not, but it is not going to be a cake walk. Most of the people I see that started as T1 and are now L6 or higher have a tenure of 5+ years; I only know of ONE person who is around the 3 year mark and at L5.",0,t3_e4l7rn,t2_11p1ke,f9cvvys,t3_e4l7rn,t5_1387r9,1575227795,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Firstly, PA's shouldn't be reprimanding anyone; if this PA is yelling at you or disciplining anyone you need to report this to HR immediately. It's not appropriate for PA's to behave like this, and quite frankly, I would encourage everyone to read the guidelines for the PA and AM role so people can better understand that PA's are there to simply ASSIST in the process, they are not management. They cannot write you up, they cannot reprimand you, they are there to assist in the process and coach associates. There is a distinct difference between what it is to reprimand someone, and coach them.

As for what your AM is telling you, you could bring it up with your Senior leadership, but there's a chance that they're the ones actually telling them to do this. Even though it is very obviously against SOP, there's nothing you can really do. Can you follow SOP? Sure. If your leadership has a problem, go directly to the Learning Coordinator. If your Learning Coordinator has any balls, he/she will bring down the hammer and defend you for following proper procedure. 

I understand their logic for not wanting to miss items out, but if the item really is missing, they are simply slowing everything down and allowing shipments to dwell. The longer a missing shipment dwells in a shippable condition, the longer they risk that shipment missing CPT time. If your PA and AM don't understand this, then they are only screwing themselves and problem-solve who will ultimately have to deal with it.",0,t3_e48emi,t2_11p1ke,f9cy17a,t3_e48emi,t5_1387r9,1575228335,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"&gt;The racial imbalance is glaring, over 90% of the higher-ups are college educated/military trained Causcasians plucked from cozy security. They're talking sheep who grossly mislead you. They love to lull you into dreamland with visions of upward movement within the warehouse, knowing full well such a path is littered with enormous hurdles without a college degree or sacrificing your entire home life for multiple years.

&gt;Plus there's obvious age/race/gender balances that the brass strive for to make Amazon look good on paper. If you got one white boy, you need one white girl, like Noah's Ark.

I can see you have far more glaring problems than your crusade against bad Ambassadors. We really don't need people like you around here. The majority of people working at Amazon really don't care what color your skin is, or whether or not you're a man or woman.

My assessment of his ability to move up is based purely on the ""conversation"" I had with him before he decided to delete his account out of embarrassment. You can't make matter-of-fact statements about Amazon, refuse to defend your statements, and then dismiss anyone who is going to scrutinize your libel as a ""corporate shill."" Based on that type of mindset, no one is going to move up in the company. When you're in an interview with competent individuals, they are going to sniff out people like this, and you will never get a promotion.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"So then it's safe for me to assume you believe there's a conspiracy here?

Amazon leadership changes quickly and I honestly have never assumed there is any amount of racial bias. I've seen the entire inbound management be all black, and in a few months become all white and then quite literally a few months later all black again, same thing hilariously happened with Learning. The beginning of the building all senior leadership was Indian at one point and once they left it was filled with Asians.

I really don't ever see it as a pattern or intentional. Most people in management move around a lot, but to assume prejudice? I wouldn't think so. 

Not going to say my anecdote is going to be replicated, but I wouldn't ever look at something through the lens of racism or prejudice. If anything, I would bet money on half of their senior leadership being anything but white a few months from now. 

Either way, I don't really see this as that big of an issue. We don't know how that building conducted their recruiting for operations, it's never the same even though there are guidelines. Unless you uncover the recruiters and HR being closet racists, I don't think there's much of a case here besides coincidence.",0,t1_f9duatq,t2_11p1ke,f9e02zb,t3_e3l4b7,t5_1387r9,1575238452,URL not found

I have on rare occasions seen someone with prior warehouse management experience go from L1 to L4 (basically skip PA), but that is rare, requires GM approval, and it won’t happen for an OM position.

My suggestion is to talk to your AM about your background and your development goals and create a written development plan. All managers have the tools to do this.

Amazon will hire directly to an OM role with external candidates, so theoretically you could quit and apply, but I’m not sure that that will necessarily qualify. If you very recently worked as an L1.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"as someone who’s done both direct and indirect. i get irritated by the over use of favoritism over functionality. when i started out busted my ass in direct function of sorting/stowing. asked about indirect told me no they were fully staffed. get good at my craft then maybe could move around. finally mastered it hit high numbers above required rate. started one day P.S a week during peak. manager wouldn’t let me get out of my direct role because i shot my foot and became so good. it was 4 of us going insanely fast so they locked us in. so i did indirect 4 times only for december. once a week. but came january feb.. 2-3 times a week! still busting my ass to get good. mastered each function of problem solve. then tried out auditing associate errors got good at that too. then bounced back and forth between both. by end august. main lead in PS changed shift and i kind of took the reigns with longest tenure. So now i basically run that indirect function this peek season! so now we have new hires and fairly new associates asking to get in to PS and when they’re told NO they cry, when they’re assigned only one day they cry, then they go ask managers why them and others only get one day but me and other close by get to do it everyday. and they start crying FAVORITISM! and that just boils my blood because they assume i just got here today and got locked into PS.. not knowing all i did and all i do to keep it running and if something fails mangers come chew me out. if stuff not cleared up i gotta stay past my dismissal to clear it up! SO NO it’s not always “unfairness” or favoritism. people sometimes just can’t except some people are good at their craft. makes no sense to move them here and there and there and there just to keep disgruntled people happy. can you imagine saying why do managers always get to manage everyday they should move them around. hello theyre there because they mostly know what they are doing. senior managers probably understand this on your site too which is why they don’t make radical changes. just keep the primary show runners and rotate the others around. i’ve seen this done in countless departments direct and indirect and this works better. that way you train the new batch while senior leads control the flow of productivity.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"it’s not just “most warehouse” BUT common sense in managerial roles to keep your best around and toss the rest. you’re building your team to run your goal as efficient as possible! L3/PA will keep 2-3 good associate of every role and move around the extras to fill voids or aid slower help! then build a better team by scouting good talent and adding it to your roster of 2-3 good associates till you have a powerhouse team! or your confident enough to identify strong workers versus garbage ones and can place them accordingly based on function requirement.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"-You can't promote internally from L1 to L6 but if you're qualified you can externally hire.

-Improvement or development of processes or technologies aren't owned by Operations. A team referred to as ACES owns that and it's largely staffed by long tenured amazonians and industry experts

-The methods for finding who is trained in what and monitoring metrics is already pretty streamlined. If your leadership team has issues communicating as a team, they likely lack that as a skill, as there are multiple ways to reach each other.

I recommend reading up on the requirements of the specific job you want, and what the role entails (You wont be designing any software whatsoever as an FC Ops manager), seeing if you meet the requirements, and applying externally. 

Just keep in mind if your interview pitch is anything like your post, you'll get shot down quick. The interview will be open ended questions asking for ""stories"" about your professional experiences that'll be graded on how well they correlate with the amazon leadership principles. Check out the STAR interview format to get a better idea, as most interviews at Amazon follow that format. 

Im sure you're bright, but ultimately you're working in a warehouse. If you have a BA and related business admin experience, with some work I think you can swing an L4 fairly quickly and work up the manager chain and from there you can try to move outside of fulfillment to go where you wanna go.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1) The mobile app.
2) assure you only have cell number in the contact page NOT email. 
3) never sit your phone down when not at work 
4) get to know your manager and see if you can find out what time of day they intend on putting VET in each day... If they hint at (or even outright tell you) what time they plan on posting, you get a slight edge. 

I purposely post VET for my crew at very different times of the day each day, so that more people get a chance at accepting it bc I found a lot of my people had other jobs and would miss the chance when I was posting it around the same time each day. 

There are some unscrupulous managers who give their ""favorites"" a heads up before they post VET. But we don't do that at my DS. 

Finally, here's my last tip.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Except the part where you can see average units per hour and such, while that may not be an exact number or even that, exact shipments. It is still a number that can probably be used in some way by an outside to get an extremely generalized idea of production alongside with general costs for the employees as well if we're considering the fact that is also tracked with the rates. Both i'm sure would be very useful to those wishing to take advantage of gathering such information.

That being said, there is quite a lot tier 1's can access on their own with the lack of restrictions on specific internal websites that should probably be locked down to a certain level of access.

comment,AmazonFC,1,File for medical LOA on the hub/Amazon a to z. They will send you paperwork for your doctor to fill out and excuse your absences. It's not up to your manager at all. Go to your doctor and explain the situation and he or she should be able to excuse you from the the first day you missed up until whatever recovery time they recommend.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"No, for things of this nature you need to always go to HR, your manager has zero influence or power on the process of keeping your or firing you. 

You need to immediately contact your HR to let them know that it was a 'medical emergency,' and hopefully they can restore your UPT and allow you to initiate the process of taking a medical leave of absence. 

The only downside here (i'm only assuming this because you didn't state it plainly if you spoke to HR) is that the first person/group you talked to wasn't HR, so as far as HR knows, you're negative UPT for any possible reason like others who mismanage time, and they're going to can you.

There are cameras at security. And obviously, they are outside as well. 

And those are just the ones I see. I’m sure they got 500 more hidden elsewhere in the building. Basically, the only places you aren’t being recorded on a camera is inside the bathrooms and deep inside the robotics floor. 

I’m sure security and LP are watching the most high risk or high traffic cameras throughout the day and can easily pull up each camera on the fly, if need be.

I should clarify, I'm speaking solely about stand up RCs and stand up walkie riders. There's reasonable safety like waiting till the truck completely stops before getting off, no horseplaying, not turning too fast while driving, and always sounding your horn all of which I'm completely supportive of. However, when it comes to ""oh you have to stop AND turn off your PIT when a pedestrian, even a fellow PIT driver is on foot in the PIT area"", don't approach an on PIT even if the driver is off the deadman, keep 3 PIT lengths between you and other PITs, 8 feet away from pedestrians. They get mad if you push 1, repeat 1, pallet a tiny bit even if you're in a trailer with no one clearly in front of you, and wanna take your license cause a pallet falls without realising that in a warehouse shit happens that is unfortunately out of everyone's control. I'm not sticking up for careless douche bags but there has to be a point where everyone has to realize that some of the shit is excessive and show us especially when there's only a handful PIT drivers some respect and not be noticeably watching us every second cause it will make all of us nervous and uncomfortable. My thing is it's kinda sad when the company trusts and has everyone less afraid of robots more than people operating equipment.

And there was a lot of immature people that should not have had their license walkies are not easy to lose control, it's possible, but the walkie literally operates the same as the sit down Walmart scooter carts.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It's really going to depend on your management, and whether they give a shit about merit. I recently found out from my old building that they skipped over everyone else that has done problem-solve in OB and picked a rebinner for a T3 role (who has literally zero experience beyond rebin, no PS experience either). The reason? I'd wager favoritism and other BS.

As long as the management in your new building isn't total garbage, I would say your next step should be pushing your AM to let you train in problem-solve and be an Ambassador. Quite honestly, and this is just my personal opinion, I don't think anyone should be T3 if they haven't been in problem-solve. As long as you're curious on your own, you will learn a great deal about how the FC functions on a deeper level than other T3's and even some people in Ops (quite a lot actually). 

When you PS you can start looking for deficiencies and make an impact beyond your normal work. Ex: Can the PS area or layout be improved? If you believe so, bring it up with your L6 and draw up a plan to have this rearranged-- this is an entirely realistic scenario, and there are many others you will probably think of just by observing the day-to-day of the FC.

This is a very short answer for what could be far more in-depth, but I just want you to get an idea.

PS and how critical it is to FC function, and Ambassador is a bit obvious; training new associates and doing your absolute best to ensure they hit their learning curve goals on time or ahead of schedule is also vital to FC functionality. 

Best of luck to you.",0,t3_e6mbun,t2_11p1ke,f9rmn29,t3_e6mbun,t5_1387r9,1575578414,URL not found

Its especially bad when you work in the delivery warehouse. As the shift goes on, the bags get fuller and fuller.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Not sure how it works at all facilities but in my facility it works like this: some departments have area managers, some have shift managers.

Area managers have a particular team that they always manage. For example it might be Saturday - Tuesday. There is another manager for Sunday - Wednesday, another for Monday - Thursday etc.

Shift managers work front half and back half. So Sat - Wed and Wed - Sun. Same responsibilities as an area manager except they have all associates who work on days that they are responsible for. 

Our larger departments have area managers, smaller ones have shift managers so it is about the same number of people of people no matter the model.

Imho it's a wash. You are better connected with your people as an area manager, but better connected with the running of the department as a shift manager.",0,t3_e6ookt,t2_o3j7j,f9s58iq,t3_e6ookt,t5_1387r9,1575586153,URL not found

Feel free to ask me any questions about my experience. I worked ICQA AM for a couple of years out of college, I left for another job shortly before I was likely to get OM.",0,t1_f9t0hp0,t2_22ty6odf,f9tu4y6,t3_e6ookt,t5_1387r9,1575638725,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"No, I would not waste your time on any textbooks about fulfillment operations, supply chain, or any of that crap; conversely, anyone who actually goes to school for that crap is utterly wasting their time. You can start in the FC as T1 and become L4 faster than someone would get a bachelors in some meme degree, and this is virtually guaranteed. The benefit to starting as T1 is you will gain far more front-line experience than an individual who is hired directly into Operations. This is why people who went right into schooling and never had any real work experience are always glowing when compared to everyone else in the work environment-- they aren't glowing in a good sense, but they're glowing because everyone notices the green pea with zero life/work experience. What i'm getting at is you will gain the respect of many more people and gain far more valuable experience being where you are and working your way up the chain.

A degree is really only worth it if you're trying to get into a unique technical field that would probably require specialized training. 

If your AM has offered to you in the past a PS spot, talk to them. Unless there are reasons for them to not like you since then, your chances of doing PS should be no better or worse since then. I would talk to them more about your aspirations than just simply your desire to PS. If they know that you want to move up and you view doing problem-solve as a vital function that you need to learn to better equip yourself, he/she should be very understanding and probably appreciate you for speaking to them. 

Operations' goal is obviously the success of the building, but *EVERY* individual in Operations should also have the side objective of advancing the careers of the associates who express an interest, or they know would make a good candidate. Your AM should care just as much about your advancement as they do theirs.",0,t1_f9sdav6,t2_11p1ke,f9tx23m,t3_e6mbun,t5_1387r9,1575640360,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Let's number each day of the week. 1 is Sunday and 7 is Saturday.

Associate A works days 7 - 3

Associate B works days 2 - 5

Associate C works days 3 - 6

A shift manager works days 1 - 4, or 4 - 7 (so 4 days each way with 1 day of overlap in the middle). 

Let's say you are the front half shift manager, you work days 1 - 4. 

On Sunday (day 1) you would have associate A reporting to you.

On Monday (day 2) you would have Associates A and B reporting to you.

On Tuesday (day 3) you would have Associates A and B reporting to you.

On Wednesday (day 4) you would have associates B and C reporting to you.

Which is ""easier"" or ""less responsibility"" though? Neither.  AMs have their own dedicated team so they always are managing the same people throughout the week, but you have to coordinate with 3 of your manager peers on any given day to do your job.

On a front half / back half model you have different people each day but your department is your own and you do not have to coordinate with anyone. Do the job your way.

Do you want to always have the same crew or do you want leeway to run things your way? It's a trade off",0,t1_f9sbags,t2_o3j7j,f9ty9b5,t3_e6ookt,t5_1387r9,1575641004,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Hi, thanks for sharing your opinion!

It would greatly help me if you could also share your opinion on the following:

1. do you think I should ask my recruiter to see if it will be possible to put me as an Area Manager at an FC rather than Shift Manager at Delivery Station?

2. Where do you think it will be easier for an Area/Shift Manager to climb up the ladder to become an OM probablt in an year and half? In FC or Delivery Station?

3. Is the weekly work hours/schedule better in FC or Delivery Station? What was your schedule like? 3 day or 4 day or 5day?  
4.What made you leave Amazon for another company?

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Nah, happy to help. 

1) I'm honestly unsure. At least from the inside, recruiting teams were separate between AMZL and NACF. I'm seeing posts saying that AMZL is more relaxed on reddit, though, which is kind of surprising, because it definitely had the 'something is going to constantly go wrong' reputation of being much newer with much less well-established processes, but YMMV I guess. 

2) I can't speak to AMZL promo timelines, but 1.5yr is probably going to be tough. In NACF, you primarily have AR sites (robots, faster pace, longer hours, more burnout) where you could get L5 in about 1-1.5yr on average. I was TNS side (larger products, slower, less employees, but more 'hard to solve systemic problems' as opposed to 'throw labor at it meat grinder' of AR) where L5 typically took 1.5-2yr. I was the first launch hire promoted at my TNS site, I got it in 1yr and would have gotten my Ops at probably 2yrs 3mos, which is... extremely unusual. I've heard of AR kids out of college getting their L7 in 3-4 years, but for every one of them I've heard of a hundred AR AMs quit in &lt;1yr. 

3) I've anecdotally heard of 90+ hours in a failing DS, but NACF TNS I'd say average 48-52 off peak and 70 during peak. I personally worked a specialized AM role (only one of me in the building), during launch I worked 70+ night shift hours across 6 days a week. After that, I was M-F days 50-55hrs a week, I didn't work much extra during peak. 

4) I probably would have stayed with amzn and jumped to project stuff once I got my L6, and I wasn't trying to leave, but I got a call for a dream role in a different city. And... don't take this the wrong way, but my quality of life is so much better. I didn't realize how much Amazon was taking from me physically and mentally until I was out of it, and it honestly feels like that year and a half of my life disappeared. Good professional experience, but man. I've only been out for a few months, but I wouldn't consider going back as anything less than a L7 for anything less than 180k, which obviously isn't reasonable. Retrospectively, it was just so much stress from uncontrollables, so many truly awful people (but also so many great ones and I generally loved my own associates and t3's), and so many mornings I'd spend at 3:30AM in the shower wishing in the moment that i had any other job. And I'm one of the people who had a 'great' experience and was literally top ranked in my FC. 

If you're a college kid, all I can really say is look at your offer letter. My 2016 offer paid me about 80k all-in as a L4. I heard offers go out closer to 55-60k in 2018. If that's the case, I heavily urge you not to take it. I don't regret the time I spent there for 80 out of college w/ my L5 putting me at ~100k, but I would have quit immediately at 60. Nobody i know is an AM because they love it, it's the $$.",0,t1_f9tznqz,t2_22ty6odf,f9u65mi,t3_e6ookt,t5_1387r9,1575645082,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It can take some time. I applied in June and didn’t hear back from them till mid last month for the first time.
I’d advise not to write to them unless they write to you atleast once so you know exactly who to address your email towards. There are many teams working around the clock, and you won’t really know who your hiring manager is. And the reason is there are two to three people who may interview you in one day or setting (if it’s via chime or telephone).
There are three recruiters in the team that get you through the interview process and they have to get approvals before they reach you. There’s the recruiting coordinator, who puts your resume forward once her team selects you. Then the regional recruiter, who tells you about who will interview you etc. And the on-boarding recruiter, who will let you know if the people who interviewed you have selected you, and what will happen next. The on-boarding recruiter will get in touch with various regional directors to see where they can place you and if you can be given relocation benefits.",0,t1_f87chmx,t2_2emp2gw2,f9w5i2c,t3_dz88bq,t5_1387r9,1575687328,URL not found

My whole team spent 3 hours changing the tape dispensers and walking around outbound looking for extra gift bags and boxes. After the stations were stocked, she gave us brooms and told us to sweep.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Actually I went from white badge to blue badge in 6 weeks then blue badge to L3 in 6 weeks. So 3 months from seasonal to L3. But I worked really hard and was tried to develop relationships with problem solve and the ops manager/Shift Assistant really early on. Got put on problem solve after 3 weeks as white badge. Learned everything I could. Kept up on tool updates and stuff that no one pays attention to so I was always most knowledgeable, to the point where PS who had been there a while would ask me if they couldn't figure something out. Made sure I kept track of all situations in which I followed amazon leadership principles to create great star stories. Then had a great interview following the star method which is your best bet for standing out in Amazon interviews. But I also went to corporate logistics. So I work in an office with 200+ L3s and up to L8. The bulk hiring they do for L3 improved my chances for sure, as opposed to a station where they only hire a single shift assistant at a time typically.",0,t1_fa1lpb8,t2_23luoa5y,fa23raq,t3_e6mbun,t5_1387r9,1575777493,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"TOM team is great compared to working inside. The environment is much more relaxed. Like the previous comment, you will start by working in the truck yard guard shack checking in - out trailers as a Yard Specialist Tier 3. Youll have to deal with friendly and not so friendly drivers. sometimes you will have to be assertive because the drivers are trying to get in and out quick! You will eventually be Hostler trained to move trailers around the yard. Inspect trailers for damage, and do yard audits. when you find problems such as broken trailers, you will make reports to have them fixed. You will have more down time compared to if you were to work inside a sort center or fulfillment center. I believe TOM teams are only in Sort centers at the moment. They will offer to pay you to go to CDL school to obtain a CDL license. When you are hostler trained, you are only allowed to drive on amazon property and trained in house. They like to promote from within, so you could eventually be promoted to a Logistics Specialist and work more on the computer doing daily projections and logistical work. The next step up is a TOM Team LEAD, who also works mostly inside doing logistics stuff, making schedules, and ensuring your team is functioning properly. Above the Lead position is the TOM Team Area Manager L5 salary position. Personally i don't see my AM doing much except bridging mistakes and Late departures to the regional manager and also hiring people. 

TOM team is awesome, but PEAK season is crazy. I recommend joining after peak so you are not bombarded with the overflow of traffic that comes into the yard. I started in June and we have moments where no trailers were coming in the yard for 30 minutes at a time. But right now, its a trailer coming and going every 60 seconds. Hostler driving is fun if you feel comfortable driving since you are alone most of the time doing your moves and wrangling drivers for their completed loads. Just don't get overwhelmed by all the moves. Safety over Speed at all times. 

TOM team is a rapidly growing field within amazon. Amazon used to hire third party drivers to drive in their yards but now its amazon employees. The next thing they are phasing out is third party truckers over the road. They are sending TOM team associates to CDL school so they can completely control their transportation operations from FC to the last mile delivery. Hope this helped.",0,t3_e6t1pd,t2_2a6hhzgv,fa61xoq,t3_e6t1pd,t5_1387r9,1575820144,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,internally rts and cycle1 have an understanding of a certain number of PS packages rts can overlook and let it kick over to p/s with issues. normally it should be a fairly low number of packages they missed. ideally 0 would be goal but i’ve been told up 200-500 is understandable. so don’t always assume OPS is unaware of the issue they gauge p/s can handle certain volume of issues. but insane amount like racks worth should definitely be called out! took me a minute to learn why we always got rts almost every night then an L3 from rts was like yup your L4 knows they just assume you guys can handle it and i was like L5 knows? to a certain discrepancy.,0,t1_f9vluhb,t2_n5g5m,fa8t3vj,t3_e74or3,t5_1387r9,1575854066,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,this is accurate! i have a more thorough understanding of the process with PS in my background. i’ve even learned several tools i can use to aid and guide an AMB who were never PS trained how to better manage their clusters through monitoring key components and benchmarks. funny story i’ve been rejected 4 times for AMB but this other day this fresh amb came to ask why his shelves looked heavy. told him to move his aa based on heaviest backlog and induct dwells. while a PA passed by and asked why he was showing me that. told him nah i’m just showing him something. he just looked at me like what??? and kept walking. went back to sorting and he finally learned how to move his AA. so these stories do build up easily like you mentioned,0,t1_f9sm98u,t2_n5g5m,fa8v1up,t3_e6mbun,t5_1387r9,1575855406,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,L3 here. Came from a DS. Worked every role then PS/Ambassador. Ambassadors at a DS ain't shit. Especially not 'essentially a PA' which is the FC term for Shift Assistant.. You can train people. And manage lanes to some degree. But your scope is tiny compared to a PA. If youre Tdr/Induct ambassador you have more responsibility. But lane monitors don't know Jack compared to a problem solver. A TDR/Yard trained problem solver has twice the maneuverability as a plain Ambassador to higher roles. Knowledge of processes and tools is invaluable.,0,t1_fa8xooi,t2_23luoa5y,fa9n6zt,t3_e7tucx,t5_1387r9,1575881351,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,depends where you work. FC (fulfillment center) vs DS (delivery station) but the the general gist is once you become blue badge you aren’t seasonal anymore regardless of hiring time. instead you’re now a permanent associate which means. after holidays when things start slowing down and obviously you don’t need as many people. when they start letting go you’re more likely to be saved vs a white badge associate. then besides that you no longer have points for attendance but instead have UPT (unpaid time) which is hourly deducted for absence and tardiness. reach a negative balance and possible termination. and holiday pays you get certain holidays paid even if worked or not. vs shite badges who don’t. either than those 3 it’s pretty similar,0,t3_e77hxa,t2_n5g5m,fadockt,t3_e77hxa,t5_1387r9,1575981107,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"He's not being rejected because of that... He's being rejected based on his termination alone. How is it a violation when Amazon has no system set up to retroactively somehow scrub everyone's internal profile based on laws passed nationwide every day?

There's a better chance of hell freezing over than this guy winning this lawsuit. The most likely outcome is Amazon reverses the decisions and rehires him and nothing else happens. It doesn't change the fact that before that law was written he was violating company policy.

I don't have inside knowledge of how Amazon's system works for hiring and firing on the HR side, but I highly doubt it isn't automated to reject people that are no longer eligible based on the circumstances for their termination (""termination"" in this case used for any reason someone leaves the company).",0,t1_facxten,t2_11p1ke,fadt0xt,t3_e7x06q,t5_1387r9,1575985438,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,it’s based on demand per shift code. they like to keep a ratio of blue to white badges. when the level of blues drop then boom conversion happen. obviously some people like to work certain shifts than other. SO popular shifts have less conversions then say a slow or empty shift like the weekends or night weekends. if you happen to be in a slow one you’ll get easy conversion but if you’re in a high demand on and it’s full of blues you’ll be waiting a minute. that none the less they usually have a uniform time frame of when they convert it’ll just range of how much they convert based on demands mentioned above. in my place i heard it’ll be till January. so not sure if it’ll be like that for you!,0,t3_e8tcqz,t2_n5g5m,faed01o,t3_e8tcqz,t5_1387r9,1575998563,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I feel that either Amazon should get rid of it or establish and communicate clear rules on how the grace period works. My problem is that there is no clearly defined rule on how it works and if there is, it is hidden or very hard to find out. 

Just take my example above. You have people that clock in at 1755 wanting to clock out or leave their station at 0425. For the longest time, nobody said anything about this but all of a sudden, the higher ups started taking notice and either threatened people with write ups or wrote them up. 

Personally, I leave when my shift ends and not five minutes before. All I want is that Amazon compensates me for every second of my time on their clocks, even if some of that time is spent walking to and from the time clocks; it's not my fault that the facility is big and it takes time get where I am needed.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Couple points here. 1) legally they are federally  allowed to round in up to 15 minute increments. So no. They are not legally required to pay you to the second. Per the FLSA. Many employees use a 7 minute rule. Using 5 minutes and only around scheduled beginning and end is considered a pretty fair policy.

2) at my station they have an even more questionable practice than write ups....

comment,AmazonFC,1,"L4 and L5 are basically just compensation promotions to position you for L6 and Senior positions thereafter. If you're going to have your Master's soon I wouldn't worry about promoting quickly, having your Master's alone will position you better than most people since at certain levels most of the time it'll come down to degree if you want to advance faster. I'm not saying this is the defacto way of advancing, but generally speaking, people who have a Master's will most likely be favored. 

Quite honestly, if I were in your position (and I knew then what I know now) and I wasn't in desperate need of an income, I would wait until I had my Master's and apply for higher level positions. The Pathways program is for people with advanced degrees and they throw these kids fresh out of school with nearly no life/work experience into L6 positions. If you already have work experience to slap on your resume on top of your Master's, it'll only help you advance faster.

So your two options are:

- Start as L4, spend a year promoting to L5, and another year for L6 and 1-2 years for L7 (banking on the area you're in has an open L7 spot and you actually get it)


- Wait until you have your Master's and apply for high level positions as an external hire

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You're only looking at L5 with a Master's, an officer in the military, and what i'm assuming is non-military work experience? No, they are shafting you big time if they are dressing up the L5 over the L4 as something exponentially better. There is no real difference between L4 and L5 other than compensation. You will have identical duties compared to your L4 counterparts. L5 is a promotion based on nothing but performance, and for the sake of advancing L5's into Senior leadership roles. 

What you have is already L6 and honestly i'd wager L7. Unless your 10 years of experience wasn't spent managing FC-size operations, your experience won't count for much at all. What does count for something is your Master's and military career. If your work experience does put you at the level of being the head of a full blown FC, or an entire department with 500+ associates and half a dozen or more other managers directly reporting to you, you need to be looking at higher level positions. 

The honest to goodness truth is that the only experience you're going to gain as L5 is the day-to-day grunt work of the FC floor. Is this worthless? Absolutely not; if you have a genuine interest in what is actually going on in your FC and what the REAL barriers to the functionality of your building are, then perhaps the L5 spot is for you. 

Oh, how could I also forget, your hours for Peak and other times will look like 18 hour days (yes, they'll be that bad).

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Some white badges I know are saying that they can’t find the conversion application available now. It was ready available last month, but it could have been temporarily taken down because this conversion period has closed. However, my FC is opening up more conversions soon. Make sure he filters by your state and selects “fulfillment center” to find it; he’ll never find it if he doesn’t filter.  It will say something like “T1-Seasonal Conversion” followed by part or full time and the name of his FC. Submitting an early application doesn’t really “speed” things up per-say, you basically just get to skip the whole application process once you’ve been offered the conversion. I received emails about completing MyDocs, but it said error, so I went to HR on-site and they looked up my login and saw that I was already good to go because I’d already applied. Today I had my orientation (30 minutes of going over the basic blue badge benefits) and got my actual badge from security, plus a free lanyard. I’ve heard around that some white badges are receiving emails stating when their last day of employment is; not sure if it’s true or not. But I do know that more conversions are coming. Make sure your boyfriend stays on top of his emails (I checked every hour that I wasn’t working) and jumps on that conversion if it comes through. My advice is befriending some blue badges and getting the real loopholes through them. I made friends just because I wanted to, the inside scoop was a bonus. 

On top of that, I do have some important advice that is NOT optional. Rate and attendance. My FC is maximum 4.5 points to be eligible for a blue badge. 6 and you’re fired. They go by your rate mostly, but if you are labor tracked (very likely at peak, I’ve been labor tracked and shared for 2 weeks), you do not have an actual rate, so HR will rely on only your attendance. Points should be as low as possible. I had 0. If I needed time off, I waited for VTO or asked my manager to slip me some if at all possible. If not, I just rode it out and dealt with it. Obviously if he really really needs to leave and can’t get VTO, take that point, but use them very wisely. The email I received about my offer was that I was “one of the top performing seasonal employees.” And that’s why they wanted me to stay. Today at orientation, there were only 6 of us converting. 

All in all, it’s not TOO difficult to be permanent, but it can get hard to compete with so many white badges around. The more white badges, the longer conversion takes. My FC hires hundreds this year. Granted, most already quit, but still, there are a lot. Also, your manager liking you can help. My manager seems fond of me, and although she doesn’t choose if I convert, she was probably putting a good word in. Im not 100% sure if HR takes recommendations into consideration, but it never hurts to be on your manager’s good side. The manager on back half, however, tells her employees that conversion is not her problem. So it definitely depends. I wish him the best of luck. He’ll feel on top of the world if he gets converted.",0,t1_faev1e5,t2_2rvr54jv,faj1xkm,t3_e7a56y,t5_1387r9,1576122224,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Delivery stations are better than FCs.
There are also two types: the AMZL for normal packages and AMXL for heavy bulking. 
The Nightshift would be the shift with a big pool of full time work as their job is to receive, induct and sort packages.
The Earlyshift (AM shift) is like 70% part-time work as is their role to prepare the routes.
PM shift is fairly small and just a hand few have full-time. Our station has SameDay deliveries and full-time associates are required for RTS from DAs.
As an example of head count:
Nshift right now has 130-150 people and all but two are full-time.
AM shift has around 70 people and 20 are full-time.
Lateshift has around 30 of which 8 are full-time.
These number are higher now do to peak volume.
It's way easier than in an FC and the existing metrics are few and easy to achieve but it is hard to land a full-time position in other shift other than the Nightshift.",0,t3_e93p85,t2_4dkz0716,faj7yst,t3_e93p85,t5_1387r9,1576127242,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"On how it is like, depends on the context, I can think of three scenarios:
1) if the station is newly opened.
In this case it can be a little bit more demanding to get things running but there should be at least one L4/L5 in the building with prior experience. You will learn alongside your team (L3+L1s) and be mentored by a L5 with experience. Upper management is more forgiving in this time. Good news is that amazon is full of Standard Operating Procedure documents and a team of SME (subject matter experts) is also sent to help new stations out. Plus, you do your onboarding at a different station till you start at your new one. So there is a lot of mentoring and chances to learn.
2) if the station is one of the good ones then life should be easy, just learn from everybody that is already there and in the building.
3) if the station is lower bottom and the shift is a mess... yeah, good luck.

As to duties, they vary from shift to shift, I can be more specific if you tell me in private message the shift and then I will explain the duties of just that one.
But in general 3 things to keep in mind:
1) you are the one that has to ensure that the KPIs (key performance indicators) of the shift will be achieved and maintained. The only down side here is that the KPIs change based on need, time of year, volume and so on. But there are not that many per shift and you just have to  train/motivate your team to achieve them and maintain them. Keep in mind to communicate your on going expectations clearly in SUM (stand up meetings) at SOS (start of shift).
2) keep engagement metrics up by being a good leader to your people. These metrics are compared with the average of the country. All SAs (sortation associates) have access to various devices (scanner type phones, few laptops, terminals) where they answer 1-2 questions per day. If you do a bad job as a leader, the engagement metric will reflect that from their answers. The questions are part of the Amazon Connections program and HR and upper management really keep an eye on the results. 
3) make sure everybody is trained and that people evolve on their roles. Keep the turn over as low as possible, in other words make sure that people not quit often and in huge numbers as this reflects on poor management from your part. Keep in mind that people come from different backgrounds and that they will do the job, even if paid shit, as long as you are fair. Also keep in mind that they chose to come to work, you do not knock on their door. So balance this. 

Once you become confident enough in your abilities and are top tier manager, delegate tasks to your L3 and L1s. This gives them room to grow and if they succeed, you succeed. Allow others to grow in your shadow. 
Message me in private and I will answer when I got the time.
Good luck with your job.",0,t1_fajqnry,t2_4dkz0716,fakjzzo,t3_e77dun,t5_1387r9,1576168417,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Get out of pick and get into an indirect role asap. You are going to hate picking about a 4 weeks to a month and a half in. Use the laptop that you have as an indirect to find available to amazon employees only through “Job Finder” which is found under “Resources” of your Amazon A to Z. IMO the only position worse than Pick is Stow, so apply for as many jobs as you can (I think the max is 6 open applications).  

You can access Job Finder from any Amazon computer, but unless you want to stay later than your normal shift or eat into your break to look at jobs, you’ll definitely want to get in as some type of PS or Pick HUD to get access to a laptop so you can apply for jobs while on shift.

Imo, the better jobs in the building are HR, Learning, IT, Safety, TOM Team and non-inventory. These jobs have little to no rate and you will have much more flexibility and freedom as a whole.

You’ll probably get denied from a fair number of jobs, but in this case, quantity&gt;quality.  As pick is one of the more crudy jobs of a FC, almost every job you apply for is an improvement. 

Once your status is “under consideration” (under “Active Applications” in “Job Finder”), talk to HR every day and ask for updates of the status of your application.

Sauce: I was in Pick for 4 months, got into Pick Hud, then applied for a job as an Equipment Coordinator a few months later and as of now I’m a Support Tech.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Most non operational jobs are the best. Lower stress, more flexibility, and as you said freedom. 

Problem is those departments are very small and either require you to work nights ( Cause no one wants to give up their day shift ) or move to another location which might not be that great seeing that its a tier 3 spot and some locations pay tier 3 very badly. 

Its easier said then done trying to get into a tier 3 permanent spot. You have to get past the obvious favoritism certain AA gets when being selected for a spot. I don't know about your FC but my FC list every tier 3 spot for one job application and its operations who gets to pick who they want. The exception being the Tom Team who do their own hiring.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It's normal for seasonal PAs to get VTO. 

Some jobs you do are just PG roles as a PA. I'd go shifts where I'd just waterspider as a PA. 

And it looks bad if you're trying to transfer to a different department while as a seasonal PA if you want to become permanent. To become permanent, you basically have to be willing to work which ever department and if you can't fulfill the role you're in now, the less likely a manager would want to pick you up.

Usually to transfer as a PA (not sure about seasonal) you need permissions from a manager and senior OPs. It goes by needs of the building and since PAs are fewer of, you'll be hard press to find a spot somewhere else just because you don't like your department. The only two times I've seen a PA transfer were one to accommodate school schedule and the other was asked (sent as he couldn't say no) to relocate to a different department because he wasn't fulfilling his PA duties in Pick.

They can cancel it if they find you're not fulfilling the duties of your role which looks worse if you plan on applying for a PA role or higher position in the future.",0,t3_ea1pjx,t2_2yi1lxy0,fan9xy6,t3_ea1pjx,t5_1387r9,1576230967,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Sorry to hear that.
About the machines, inform them every time that they break often and that is a barrier for you, you raise thr flag this way and do you part to call it out.
Helping others to the detriment of your own rate is not such a good thing if nobody important knows of it. I know it sounds shitty but you have to be selfish and just shine with bias for action when ears hear about it or eyes see it and gets passed on. 
Regarding the break time, do not take it personally, they would do that with anybody as a safety measure to make sure that associates do not take longer breaks.
The thing is that good leaders should identify the spot in which an associate shines as all people are different and excel at different things, sometimes it takes a little push like someone with experience in your process saying good things about you and stuff like that.
Do other associates in your process hit their rates daily?
If everybody hits their rates that will reflect badly on you and at this point the solution would be to ask to be paired with someone with experience to learn the tricks of the trade and also show that you are willing to learn and are not just content to struggle until they let you go (i know you are not content but this is how they see it).
If the other associates fail to hit their rates often then the whole process has some shitty metrics.
The sad reality is that sometimes they just fire associates thinking that is has to do with the human factor and not the shitty metrics or process, that leads to a high turn over in some process and only after that happens they think that maybe the metrics and process needs tweaking.
Tl:dr: report your problems, stop helping others if nobody important sees it, try to be paired up with someone that hits their metrics. If it all fails it, then let it be, no need to suffer and live a misarable life just to hit those metrics and there are surely other things that you can do where you feel valued and good at them.",0,t3_eb97n9,t2_4dkz0716,fb3gvt3,t3_eb97n9,t5_1387r9,1576472756,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,2,"Depends from country to country and city to city. Also it depends if the L4 came from the outside or got promoted from L3 to L4. From the outside you can get more as you are allowed to negociate if the recruitment team really wants you. 
The RSUs (stocks) are the golden goose for those L4 that stay at least 2 years. Also outside L4 can have bonuses when they sign in. But the per hour pay is not that impressive. 
In Delivery Stations for example it says in the contract that you are expect to work 40 paid hours per week and another 8 unpaid if needed by business demand.
Also in Delivery Stations there is no paid over time for L4 or days off with extra hours. This happens because L4s do not badge in like the associates so the hours are never counted.",0,t1_fb3giai,t2_4dkz0716,fb3hp85,t3_eb1kxc,t5_1387r9,1576473474,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The same thing happened to me when I moved from night shift to day shift. It’s a huge learning curve for some of us. I thought that if I moved from Stow to Packing, I wouldn’t have too many issues making rate. Moving from nights to days did help, but I often found myself trying to replicate my success in Stow working in AFE. Well, rate wasn’t my only problem. I ended up getting sick at work and had to take leave. In fact, I found myself getting sick more often when I was working in Packing. After I returned from leave, I went to Gift Wrap and I loved it! I ended up going back and forth to a wall then to Gift Wrap due to the lack of work in Gift Wrap. That was annoying and of course, my rate suffered. When I worked in Stow at nights, for some reason, I always made rate. I even made 5k and would win gift cards during Peak even though it took me forever to get to the same level of the people that I was hired with. My advice to you would be not to worry about others or comparing rates with your peers as hard as it may be. Once I stopped worrying about others, I started to feel better about my productivity. Also, take care of yourself. This job is not worth you being sick and messing up your health. Take care of yourself! If you have time, use it!

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Make sure to take advantage of your learning curve time. You have about 5 weeks where rate isn't actually enforced. Take it slow at first and build up. Make sure you're not overheating. I personally work in a Florida FC and we don't have the best ventilation and our winters are a cool 80 degrees so it's easy to have heat related injuries. Ice baths if you're super sore are also your friend. You'll hate them but it will help. Get some good shoes, heel pain is a bitch. If you get swelling in your feet, check your diet and maybe get compression socks, you might be high on sodium. Also know the symptoms of dehydration and watch out for them.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I was also relieved to see that there weren’t many horror stories about working at Amazon when I first started. I worked at nights in RSP Stow and then I quit and came back to work days in AFE Pack. I was labor shared to Receiving and Ship Dock and  I have much more respect for what you all do! Such backbreaking work but quite a few folks love working there! My advice to you would be to stretch before coming to Stand Up. Especially since you’ve been sitting in your car and driving to work. Stretch during Stand Up. You’ll see the veteran employees standing around and joking. Don’t fall into that habit. When you have time between moves, stretch then. Also, stretch a little before getting into your car and driving home. Then stretch again when you get home. It will take your body some time to adjust to the work that you are doing, especially if you aren’t really active on your own. Wash your hands. Make use of the sanitation stations around the warehouse. Use your PPE! Do things safely and ask questions. If your manager or PA doesn’t know, find someone that does.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Before getting to your station, always grab a row of tape on your way. As soon as you get to a station sign in, don't bother getting any boxes until you need them. There is always a chance a waterspider will show up and save you that time. If you do need a box you don't have at the moment go get it plus get some of another box you are getting low on at the same time.

While making your box, look left and right so you will know where your items are at. Do not go out of your way to help others, it only hurts you. If someone does ask for help, spend as little time as possible on it just to not be rude. It's what andons are for. Even steal boxes from close empty stations if needed, everybody else does it.

The rate the managers say they want and what gets you let go are two different things. Their job is get people to work as fast as possible and this is one of the ways they do that. There should be a computer around that lets you compare your rate with everyone else's. I don't often get the rate managers want, but I am still faster than 80%-90% of everyone else so unless there are huge layoffs, u am not going to be let go.",0,t3_eb97n9,t2_lwb8m,fb69wn2,t3_eb97n9,t5_1387r9,1576545054,URL not found

In terms of water, I just bring a standard disposable plastic water bottle (Dasani or whatever) and refill it throughout the day and just carry it around with me in my back pocket.

In terms of impressing management, it depends on the person of course, but generally being willing and enthusiastic to do any job they request of you, ask questions if you don't know something and want to learn more, and be open to learning any new skills or jobs they ask you about.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Everything else has been covered, but I think there is another aspect here that is important. If your intent with asking what to do that looks good for management is to move up, or be placed into other roles like problem-solve, your first order of business should be moving over to a different schedule that is full time. 

It's not really a solidified rule, but generally my experience had been that they won't take people with odd schedules. If I had the option between vouching for someone who worked Saturday/Sunday or Sunday-Wednesday, I would pick the person who worked Sun-Wed. Why? For the sake of consistency and normalcy during the work week. 

I'm not sure what your aspirations are, but if 'looking good for management' is to be translated as ""I want to promote or do _________ role,"" you need to get a different schedule if that is possible for you.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"All i'll say is this: don't go into Amazon with that type of mindset- ignore what you hear from other people. The FC environment is not easy, it is physically work for 10 hours, and people somehow seem to forget or overlook this. 

With that said, my greatest advise I would give you is go in with a positive mindset and the realization that Amazon is enormous, and as big as its size, so will be the opportunity within Amazon. Amazon is growing at an astronomical rate, and being part of it here and now couldn't be a better time. I don't know a single thing about Amazon Air, but I would look at this as a good opportunity. Once you're in, you have something pretty unique to slap on your resume. Amazon Air isn't something you hear about very often, so i'd leverage your situation and learn whatever you possibly can. You can transfer *almost* anywhere you want within Amazon, and equally so in terms once you start promoting.

Sounds like you're in a unique situation; run with it man, and come back to the sub with all the crazy shit you find out once you're working in Amazon Air.

There's a very difficult balancing act going on right now. Way back when, Amazon predicted there'd be X amount of sales this Christmas season, so they hired Y associates and Z temp/seasonals. It costs money and time to train people, so FCs are doing their best to retain as many people as they can for those days when everything is running at max capacity. It also costs money to have AAs standing around when we aren't at max capacity, so they offer VTO sometimes.

What a lot of AAs don't seem to understand is if you take a day of VTO, your paycheck will be $150 lighter. Do take a day two weeks in a row and you are out $300. That starts to bite. Sometimes AAs will find another job to even out their income, so sometimes a facility will over-pick to keep their people employed and close at hand. 

And other times, managers like to exceed goal because they think it makes them look good. (it might, I have no idea how managers are assessed)

comment,AmazonFC,1,"In order to become an ambassador you would have to ask Learning if they have any positions open for it. Once they do, keep asking your area manager or PA to sign you up for it. Bare in mind that you can’t have any write ups or you won’t be eligible to become an Ambassador. Working 40+ hours can really be tough sometimes but you get used to it, I’ve learned that doing something different every day helps out.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Timberland Pro they are like composite safety shoes or something because you have to wear them at the airport to get through security instead of steel toe. 

I've only worn them for about 10 hours but I really like them so far. For the past three years I've had feet trouble because I walked a lot at my last job, I've used inserts, toe covers, a silicone bridge under my toes, etc. But these seem to fit well and I only need the toe bridge in them because my last shoes smashed my toes together and gave me calluses, so I hope these solve that issue, because one little callus on your toe can mess you up.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I assume you’re a hire straight out of college? Normally they assign you to an FC.

BUT, if you do get a choice, my vote is a hard pass on any new launch and to go with an existing FC.

You are unlikely to get any additional RSUs or signing bonuses for a new launch while you’ll be putting in a hella lot of OT hours to support the launch. Like 16 hour days for the first month.

Just my two cents but personally I would say (if you get a choice) to go with an established FC.

That’s not saying there aren’t also pros to doing a new launch, and it can be a good experience to get under your belt (I have done three, lol), but the extra hours (unpaid, of course) that you’ll be putting in really do make it hard to say it’s worth it in the end.",0,t3_ecl98o,t2_1kfh9p8x,fbdji51,t3_ecl98o,t5_1387r9,1576763955,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It’s the exact same just a permanent position and you get full benefits and stock RSUs every year.

The hours are not longer (unless you went from a part time temp/white badge to a full time blue)... basically the job is identical you just got compensated a lot better once you factor everything in (even if the base hourly wage is the same).

Not sure if white badges get VCP pay each month (maybe you can confirm?) but that’s basically free money as a blue badge. 10% is based on rate, the rest is on attendance and hours worked, basically an extra $400 a month for showing up at work which you do anyways. And also the discount... which isn’t much to write home about itself, but it’s just another benefit.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Generally, I can tell you that as a manager, over-executing your target volumes is *not* seen as a good thing. Senior management does not want you to over-execute by more than 5% (or under-execute by more than 5%). Max generally bridgeable is 10% over-execution. Anything else and there will be questions asked... they’d rather labor be coded into FC-Uncontrollable idle hours than to eat into the next shift’s WIP. 

It doesn’t necessarily make the manager running the shift “look good” to over achieve on volume plans.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Personally i'd go with the newly launched FC. If your goal is advancing throughout Amazon, it would serve you better to go into a new FC where things are still ""fresh."" Established FC's really don't face that many problems (unless there are systemic issues that leadership has failed to address). FC's have changed over the many years that Amazon has existed. The layout of two identical FC types (on paper, such as say a traditional non-sort) might be entirely different; this is why you can't compare FC's and say ""it's all the same experience."" This is/was always my gripe with management when they would make demands based off of other buildings that, although the same type of building, were build entirely different and operate entirely different.

A new FC is NEW, as in not just that it was built recently, but that it is most likely going to differ in many other ways that will allow you to be ahead of the game when other similar sites go up, of which you may or may not want to assist in launching as well.

I won't bother explaining to you how much work it is, because this should be something you are well aware of and should expect at an AM level; you are entry-level in terms of management, yeah, it's going to suck ass.

Being part of a new building will look better for you as well. You're going to be one of the few people present (albeit a little ""late"" to the party) and contributing to a new building succeeding. Building with brand new leadership (some, not all) and brand new associates is difficult, because nothing has been established yet. You probably don't have an away team there assisting anymore, but you will have many roles that are still establishing, such as problem-solve. Depending on the type of site, problem-solve will vary in its complexity, and a good problem-solver will take several MONTHS before they have mastered every single area under their wing and the software tools that go along with it. Being part of and assisting in those indirect roles are invaluable when you're present for the initial educational experience. 

I'll end this here, so as not to make it too long-winded, but I hope you get the point. Sure, you can go to an already established FC where it's going to most likely be easy, but if you are seeking a feeling of fulfillment and like you're actually contributing to something, go with the new FC.",0,t3_ecl98o,t2_11p1ke,fbdoqdk,t3_ecl98o,t5_1387r9,1576767811,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The claim barely paying its employees isn't exactly accurate. Amazon FC Tier 1 starting pay is higher than comparable jobs in any given building's location. All of those military veterans and people with disability accommodations that work alongside us are a huge reason why Amazon has low taxes. The United States Government has tax incentives for businesses to hire veterans and people with disabilities. The take home pay for those people even after the taxes they pay is still higher than what they would be receiving if they just sat at home collecting benefit checks.   


Secondly our 401(k) plans allow for us to have 2% of our pay matched and invested directly in a fund that owns Amazon stock. So even without DSPP or RSU's Tier 1 employees literally are receiving a share of the means of production merely for being workers, which ironically for one of the most successful capitalist organization in a capitalist country meets Marx' ideals of socialism far more than anyone else has done properly in history. I just wish that after being a blue badge for a year that we'd see our contributions raised to 10:5 and then after five years maybe up to 15:7.5 and bring back RSUs, perhaps even as a peak performance incentive bonus.  


That being said, I still think there should be a more progressive income tax structure like we used to have in the good ole days of the 1950's to pay for things like roads, hospitals, fire protection, public parks, and especially schools. The reason I avoid Twitter is that there is little room for nuanced discussion. This post kinda reaffirms that belief.",0,t3_ecwtwa,t2_4noia19,fbecz4k,t3_ecwtwa,t5_1387r9,1576783211,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"This again.

&gt;companies shouldn't exist to make a profit! They should exist to fund my welfare check!

-

&gt;how dare those companies attempt to lessen their tax burden! Only an individual who doesn't own a business with $200+ BILLION in expenses should have to pay zero taxes!

Do I need to make a mockery of these half-baked arguments any further?

Income tax is not the only tax that businesses accrue. People are naive to think taxes have no repercussions on businesses, and that it has no direct impact on the worker. I will laugh myself into a coma when I hear people complain about getting no pay increases across the board when a company already shells out almost all of their revenue in expenses alone, not even counting other ancillary taxes that are not income taxes.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It isn't accurate at all. Most of the work in Amazon is for unskilled labor. Sure, there are IT guys and it helps to have a degree if you plan to start as a PA or higher but the vast majority of the positions are unskilled and a monkey with half a brain could do it.

My location pays $15 hourly and I get a $0.60 cent shift differential. There are not many jobs that match that in Houston unless you have secondary education or are wiling to work in the chemical plants, which requires paying for a TWIC card and is very hard work with long hours. 

Then people also tend to forget how easy it is to get hired on at Amazon. The application process was surprisingly strings-free and just requires one to pass a background check and drug test (cotton swab, which is easy to fool, if one is so inclined and I know a few people that did). 

I like more money but I am happy with what I get now.

If anything, Amazon is a fun little microcosm of much larger issues.

I don't believe anyone is being denied or discriminated against, I honestly believe Amazon actively looks under rocks to fill up its facilities with a rainbow of color in every position. Unfortunately, such a thing must be hard to find. And especially during a new launch, the cogs in the Amazon fulfillment machine need to be super strong with little question about cracks and weaknesses.

Although it certainly doesn't help matters in the grand scheme of it all, when Amazon builds its FC's in shitty neighborhoods, hoping to provide good opportunities to the disadvantaged residents, but then Amazon drops a crazy taxing workload on their heads, doesn't properly address their poor time management skills, their less than desirable verbal or interpersonal skills or their lack of initiative, situational awareness, commitment, stick-to-itiveness, etc. Then on top of it,  Amazon dangles instant, easy-peasy ""unearned"" promotion in their faces, feeding into their Prince/Queen ""turn the tables"" mentality.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"&gt;Ha!... you're funny... you just said the most racist thing ever

Go ahead and point out what I said that's supposedly racist and actually defend your claim, because i'm about to dismantle the rest of your response. 

&gt;The lack of qualified black candidates becomes quite apparent when there's a Lily White Garden of bosses blossoming in front of you.

Oh, I see, so you finally admit that you believe that it's actually *racism* and *prejudice* that are keeping the black candidates out of leadership. Did you not just comprehend what I just stated in terms of data? You know, the one you dismissed as ""wow, those are racist numbers!"" The point was that black candidates are not as plentiful as other ethnic groups. What you're propagating is a conspiracy among white leadership to supposedly keep out non-whites. 

&gt; but then Amazon drops a crazy taxing workload on their heads,

It's a warehouse, what are you actually expecting? Define ""crazy taxing."" Nothing about the FC is ""crazy taxing"" unless you're someone with zero physical stamina. Why would you apply to work in a physically demanding environment, and then complain about said work environment? Would you also complain about the work being physically taxing if you went to work at UPS or FedEx? 

I want you to actually tell me what your idea is of what a warehouse is supposed to be. 

&gt;doesn't properly address their poor time management skills,

I'm assuming 'their' is referencing FC management. It's a mixed bag, as in any job. You're going to have your seasoned veterans, and you're going to have your newbies fresh out of college with literally zero work experience; but to dress up your claim as if this is some systemic problem throughout all of Amazon, no, you're incorrect. 

&gt; their less than desirable verbal or interpersonal skills or their lack of initiative

Same as the above. 

&gt;situational awareness, commitment, stick-to-itiveness

Sigh... same as above.

&gt;Then on top of it, Amazon dangles instant, easy-peasy ""unearned"" promotion in their faces, feeding into their Prince/Queen ""turn the tables"" mentality. Nothing will change inside or outside of Amazon if this continues.

Sorry, but what? Lets try to deconstruct what you've just said... essentially, your complaint in its totality is that: 

1. Leadership bad

2. The undeserving get promotions

3. Amazon should exist to serve the people it employs and any single failure on any front is evidence that Amazon needs to ""change"" 

Lets break this down very simply; leadership will always be a mixed bag, the deserving and undeserving will always get promoted, and last but surely not least, Amazon does provide more for communities than most companies. This is a ludicrous illustration you've portrayed, and i'm beginning to understand this is some personal vendetta between you and Amazon.

Maybe someone with more sort center experience can chime in here. 

I'm trying to be sympathetic with your situation, but I think there is a bit of pushing back on your end that you could do.

As for your bank account, Amazon can give you a pay card that will be directly deposited into, so go talk to your HR about this as well, hopefully they can help you that.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Sort centers sometimes do 3 and out. Usually means they shut down the shift(sort) after 3 hours because there isn't enough work.

Except I currently work at a sort center, the only shift that works less than 4 hours is the 12:30am to 4:30 am, but only leave 30 minutes early. The 4:30am to 8:30am shift leaves at 8:30.

Every other shift is flexed up an hour the last 2 weeks. 

So OP must be taking VTO.

Also, OP states they are mad for wasting gas. I know people who work the 8pm to 12am shift, get flexed up an hour til 1am. Go to their car or breakroom and sleep and then work the 4:30am shift. They don't have to drive back and forth.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Whoaaa...whoaa... buddy... stop the clock, you're just wanting to flame. Are you Jeff Bezo's son/daughter or something? I've lost track of your points, other than you seem to be a diehard Amazon fanatic. 

So mathematically speaking there should be more white people on an American football team, right?... And in your scenario, ONE Asian beat out 9 blacks. A total of nine job seeking Blacks showed up to be interviewed, but they all lost out to one Asian. They successfully completed college, a role at Amazon appealed to them, they did mock interviews at home, they got dressed up, they psyched themselves up in the car, they get there, they look around the waiting room and said wow look at all my fellow black college grads sitting here, at least one of us is gonna get the job, the numbers are surely in our favor..... UHHHH NOPE!... THE ASIAN GOT IT! 

I clearly said, I do believe Amazon TRIES to hire people with all sorts of backgrounds for top positions, buttttt....... as I witnessed, achieving this in reality seems to be a bit harder to do than on paper. So what you end up with is a couple of powerful whites in the front office (so to speak), piloting a very large body of blacks down on the field, thus it becomes reminiscent of olden slavery times inside a technically advanced, robotics facility.

Amazon appears to have good intentions, it wants to help move the country and disenfranchised, marginalized communities forward, while at the same time running an extremely profitable business, but so much of the Amazon system is extremely flawed, and it only helps to contribute to more problems.

Also, it doesn't matter what I expect warehouse work to be like. Nobody knows what it's like until they get there and experience it first-hand. Plus since my building was a new launch, Amazon was and continues to hire ANYONE, people with zero job experience or huge gaps in their work history... heavily pregnant, super short, terribly overweight, gimpy walkers, very old, immensely childish, bad dental hygiene, you name it.  

Amazon FC's are unable to properly accommodate these people and their handicaps. Amazon doesn't recognize them as people, only NUMBERS, so they are set up for failure right from the very start. And I believe most people wouldn't ever attempt to apply for such a job if the glamorous, visionary Amazon logo wasn't attached. They walk in there expecting to get a days worth of work done as easily as they order junk online. I think they also expect it to be much more automated, or more relaxed and looser, like the dress code.",0,t1_fbh8or5,t2_3qgbyvzu,fbhljs0,t3_e3l4b7,t5_1387r9,1576876547,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,Also with the money side I said I only make about 90 a day with a 6 hour shift which when I do 6 hours costs me about $24 in gas to get to and from work when i have to double back instead of waiting around for 3 extra hours. So on a normal 3 hour shift its 45 minus tax makes it more like 40 or less per shift. Leaving me with $15 profit a day excluding expenses. No one can live off 15 a day for Bill's man. 15x6 days is only 90 a week worth of money saved.

As far as getting the FC running and stable, the seasoned managers really made the difference. With all the chaos that comes with launching (still existing even 10 months in, when I started)  I would personally recommend getting the experience at an existing FC before getting involved in a launch.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"So far it's a pretty easy and low stress job. We did a bunch of security training since it's an airport and that took a few days. A lot of it is ""need to know"" and they said don't talk about it, but the work is basically like a UPS place or something. There are a bunch of jobs, but mainly two that you get hired for off the bat: ramp and sort. 

Ramp people unload huge containers off of Boeing 747 jets using normal airport type vehicles and marshall airplanes around the airport, then they send the containers inside for sort to unload onto conveyor belts and send the packages to empty containers that need filled. Then they get the newly loaded ones out to the planes to go to other hubs.

Sort either unload the container onto conveyor belts, or load the unloaded packages into new containers for ramp to load back onto the planes. You catch the packages off of a conveyor belt that  knocks it onto a chute that leads to your shipping container and you grab it and basically play Tetris with packages. The only attention to detail that you need to pay in sort is that the packages you're sending down the conveyor are marked with your airport name, and if not you send it down a chute to be sent to the right place. Out of 5 containers and probably thousands of packages I only found 2 that were at the wrong airport, so it all seems pretty efficient.

I had a nightmare about packages flying down while I tried to grab them and stack them, but it's pretty easy to do and you have plenty of time to get it done and plenty of help from other sorters who might have a slow chute. 

Then there are training ambassadors, PAs, IT, HR etc, jobs that you can apply for after 30 days. So far so good, the work isn't very stressful but standing for so long is hard on your feet. I'm happy with the job, it's not at all what I was expecting but I'm glad I applied and got the job.",0,t3_ebzmpo,t2_t0cg1,fbiuql5,t3_ebzmpo,t5_1387r9,1576915220,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"1.5x holiday OT pay for working, regardless of your weekly worked hours are actually in OT yet or not.

1x straight time holiday pay whether you work or not, for the length of a regularly scheduled shift for you. So 8 hours holiday pay if you have 8 hour shifts, 10 hours for 10 hour shifts, etc.

Typically, after adding both, most people should be making a total of 2.5x regular pay if working on a holiday.

Talking another full time. Not sure how part time is paid for holiday pay. But full time employees get holiday pay for the length of a regular shift whether they work or not.",0,t3_edig8x,t2_1kfh9p8x,fbj6la9,t3_edig8x,t5_1387r9,1576926083,URL not found

The app glitches and sometimes doesn't process. So you'd usually have to call ERC immediately after or wait for a confirmation email. When I put mine through the app and the confirmation (or error, in my case) popped up in the app I did a screenshot to cover myself.

If it were in person resignation and you resigned day of, you wouldn't have been able to even log into the atoz app right now. Or they may not have processed it yet. 

You will definitely have to call ERC so they can write a ticket especially if you plan on re-applying within the next year.

**Medical Marijuana**  


Federal law prohibits marijuana use for any  reason, classifying marijuana as a drug with ""no medical use,"" and, as a  general rule, the use of marijuana is prohibited under this policy.  However, in recent years, many states have legalized medical marijuana  with a certification/prescription from a state agency and/or licensed  health care provider. When used in compliance with state law, Amazon  treats medical marijuana the same as any other medication that poses a  risk of impairing one's cognitive or motor function.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Disclaimer: this is not medical advice, I am not a doctor

I have worked inbound for over a year in the #1 busiest sort center in the country.

1. Safety first, always, no matter what.  Use step stools, and lights.  I see so many people not using these.
2. Nose over toes, don't rotate lower back at all, rotate with legs and feet.
3. Overextending is what causes injuries, don't make big movements reaching far or high for things, reach as close as possible, use short movements. Keep surfaces and conveyors close as safely possible.
4. Pick heavy boxes up with your legs with back straight up. 
5. Use your hands like you have mittens on, don't pick things up stretching your fingers really far apart. 
6. Don't try to catch boxes, let it fall or get out of the way. 
7. Ibuprofen works better for back pain than Tylenol.  Aleve works well too.  Both have side effects, consult doctor. 

Area Manager should give less physical role, and see a doctor like the other people have said.",0,t3_eejlls,t2_9jz3orq,fbvbg9s,t3_eejlls,t5_1387r9,1577128379,URL not found

ToT can be edited; the system that they use is not complex, and editing your ToT is as simple as a few clicks, it really isn't that big of a deal. 

You're describing what sounds like your L6 Operations Manager. If you're being truthful and reasonable in your statement here, I would escalate to your L7 Senior Ops or even HR if you really feel it's necessary. If your OM is so clueless that they don't know how to edit your ToT or how to staff you guys properly when there is no work, i'd assume they are more green than the new grass I just seeded, or... they just don't give a shit. 

If I were in your exact shoes and your direct management wasn't being helpful, I'd say fuck this and go straight to my L7- there's no recourse for going this route.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I had an employee going through something similar in the past, and the ERC contacted HR and they tried to terminate him. This decision was apparently based on the fact that somewhere in the agreement for employment, it states that you will maintain a working cell phone and access to the hub, and without that, employment will be terminated.

At that point, I simply downloaded a free text, call, app from the app store on my phone, and created a new telephone number that would ring and send texts to my phone. I sat with him while he called the ERC, and force the ERC to change his telephone number on file to this new temporary number. He was then able to log into the hub, and receive the 2FA code at the telephone number in the app on my phone.

So I would suggest try doing that.",0,t3_ecywfs,t2_lgxrulq,fbw96kw,t3_ecywfs,t5_1387r9,1577143861,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Did your sort center ask you for schedule preferences recently? (Ours opened Dec. 10th to the 18th.)

Usually if you started seasonal before a certain time (our sc is before Nov. 2nd) you keep the schedule you have and keep working until conversion.

If you entered schedule preferences, they will adjust your schedule that fits business needs.

Some centers just keep seasonals on a as needed basis while others let people go once the season ends (usually tomorrow, Dec 24th or the 31st). 

First time I worked at a sort center they had a new, only for the season shift. Once Dec. 24th hit at least 60% of the people were let go. Currently, our site has all the people who didn't enter schedule preferences or declined the schedule given to them will have their last day be January 4th.

Definitely ask HR if you need more clarification.",0,t1_fbw9i5v,t2_2yi1lxy0,fbwd3j9,t3_ees837,t5_1387r9,1577146755,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Trans AM.

Our site has a transshipment AM (for transfer in *and* transfer out IXD). Probably the greatest AM role in history.

Trans in can take time to grasp to know the process (like everything at Amazon, there is no one simple app - you’ll have a ridiculous number of browser tabs open just to bring in a fucking trailer to the dock) - but all things considered it’s definitely top of my list for an AM.

Getting reactive trans in shipments stowed and closed on time within SLA can be a pain in the ass and ultra high pressure at times though, especially when you have multiple reactive transfers with high unit counts show up at the same time or within a short window. Sometimes you gotta dig in your heels with the stow AM to demand more stowers come and stow from trans in.

But again, solid role.",0,t3_ef6vdl,t2_1kfh9p8x,fbzoayr,t3_ef6vdl,t5_1387r9,1577253784,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It has the potential to be a very fun place to work at. I started at logistics center before transfer to a FC. But it's essentially controlled chaos and if something disturbs the delicate balance of one it's hell.

Pros: Less rules, more relaxed, very little accountability

Cons: Less safe, no full time positions unless PA+, 30hr max a week otherwise, very little accountability

Most people in logistics work there as a second job so they aren't as invested as working as hard in there which makes more work for everyone else. Management has way less control over things than they would in a FC meaning that, which was the case where I used to work, if all the workers figure that out they can just sit around on their phones doing nothing all day with no write ups being handed out. If write ups are handed out they take so long to process through the systems in place for them that it's near impossible to be fired from write ups even if actively seeking them out. Where I worked it turned to hell the moment 1 single AM threatened workers with write-ups if they are on their phones during standup. Workers noticed lack of write ups even if approached, this everyone started doing the same. There literally was nothing they could do to repress what they started in time for peak and luckily I left early October.",0,t3_efahbv,t2_5arew75n,fc041fa,t3_efahbv,t5_1387r9,1577277540,URL not found

My advice. Listen to your workers.
Everyone almost always has issues with something and so will you. Lend an ear, offer a solution or ask if they have a proposed solution to something, or bring any issues to a PA+ and relay back if you can. This will boost your trust.

Also if you don't yet have it get shoe insert pads for your shoes, you will be walking a shit ton especially if being placed as a line lead.

Lastly if there is one thing to always get better at working on is relaying information. You will have to switch from talking to an AM at a college level vocabulary to speaking to another associate or even another AM with elementary vocabulary.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Your options actually at the FC are limited, HR and the other roles people here have references are the closest to a desk job you'll find. Working at a corporate site probably would lead down that path as well, but finding a position that isn't a role requiring some form of horse shit degree, or something technical, will be difficult. 

If you're really that interested, i'd go talk to your HR about employment opportunities at corporate locations. 

One thing I should mention- now that you're internal it's going to be far more difficult since you can't generally skip levels, and most levels in a corporate setting are probably going to all be L4 and above. Places like Data Centers that are more ""desk"" oriented have L2, but they're niche and not commonplace. 

Talk to your HR to see what your options are.",0,t3_eg3hpn,t2_11p1ke,fc5eslh,t3_eg3hpn,t5_1387r9,1577455467,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Having a degree is going to give you a pretty good advantage depending on what you have your degree in. Letting your Ops know that you have a degree and want to move up will be a good first step. 

I said talk to HR because it's usually your HRBP that will be going to corporate HR meetings and such, and usually rub shoulders with that crowd more, but like I said above, speak with your Ops as well and let them know about your degree and desire to advance. 

Because you're internal, unless there's an opening right now, you probably won't promote anywhere until you actually have some tenure under your belt. T3 isn't hard, but going for other roles outside the FC that require L4+ will require you have tenure with Amazon as an internal (not as a rule necessarily, but kind of a rule...). Take the time to learn your function, it'll be worth it to say you've at least contributed to the success of your site.

After THAT, I simply clicked 'Forgot Your Password?' they sent me a reset PIN# in my email (or text if you choose).

The issue comes when people start leaving their stations 10 minutes early to clock out 5 minutes early. A half-dozen people?

comment,AmazonFC,1,It’s a very grey area. At delivery stations you can have your phone in your pocket with you but you can’t be on it using it unless it’s for emergencies or unless they send out VTO/VET.

comment,AmazonFC,1,It’s a very grey area. DS allow you to carry your phone in your pocket as we don’t have metal detectors &amp; like 8 lockers in the whole warehouse. You can have a phone on you but you obviously can’t be texting all shift long or anything. So that’s how they send it out through AtoZ.

comment,AmazonFC,1,It’s definitely a very easy job and laid back but the warehouse politics/drama make it outrageous! I worked at a TNS FC before resigning &amp; reapplying to a DS a few years later &amp; although the FC was cutthroat &amp; strict I enjoy the atmosphere much better than a DS. I’ve found that the favoritism and nepotism/cronyism is much stronger at a delivery station because the leniency is a lot higher. Don’t make rate for a month straight? It’s OK as long as you’re cool with the right people and laugh at the right jokes. Four hours of time off task? I’ll just erase it you’re good in my book. Negative UPT? It’s OK it was just an error I’ll adjust it &amp; add some back so that you’re at 0 or higher. Versus at a FC it was very much write-up happy &amp; an absolute stickler for the rules to the T. Plus they basically have you working 30 hours a week for a little to no actual benefits. It’d ultimately be better to just tack on another 10 hour shift &amp; get full-time benefits!,0,t3_efahbv,t2_4ioyfgo6,fcdxiaf,t3_efahbv,t5_1387r9,1577614804,URL not found

Yea it uses and hour of UPT even if it's only a certain amount of mins. 

You can use sick time to avoid the waste of 20 mins in UPT and use sick time so you get paid for it.

Speak with HR about it they might be able to work something out usually everyone gets 1 freebie when late or missing part of a shift etc

Also aslong as you apply UPT or sick time you wont get in trouble and aslong as you have UPT and forget to apply it it will automatically take care of it for you.

I informed him of what you just told me he got loud and said okay just watch and see.  I told the associate not to worry they have a process to go through but he needed to work on getting his rate up and not be in the 5 percent.

comment,AmazonFC,2,"I think you're right on the nose regarding communication, but I'd honestly not expect most AMs that were external or college hires to understand the hourly employee time system.

Most of them are brand new managers at best, and brand new to Amazon without any associate experience at worst.  To help your FC with that communication piece:

You aren't getting paid (or docked pay) for those missing/extra minutes within the grace period, but you're also not working.  Part of the problem is the concept of ""clocked in.""  Being clocked in is just a way of tracking attendance, you aren't actually working yet. You're not actually working or at your place of work until you are at standup (or a station) at the beginning of shift, and the expectation is that you're producing (at your station) until your shift ends.  In short, walking between the time clock and your actual work location is not a part of your job any more than the walk between your car in the parking lot and the building.

Sign in with your Amazon login and password. Even if you never created your own password you should have been given a sheet when you started work at your orientation that had your default password. Your login is on your badge.

Click your name and then click resources. You should see a link to your pay stub site from there. Depending on your region and employment type the pay stub provider may vary (ADP for full time US employees, Dayforce for Canada, etc) - but is located in the same spot on A to Z.

If you don’t know your password call the ERC. The number is +1.877.467.1383 and the hours are 06:00-18:00 PST every day of the week.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Im in the same boat waiting to hear what happens next. I got hired on as a seasonal employee the second week of December at a delivery station with a new hire group of about 9. Watched about 3-4 quit and never come back, a few got write ups and several of them got points and such for not showing up or being late. I still have a clean record and my floor managers are very supportive of me. They seem to transfer their hardest working employees to stowing (where I’ve been the last few shifts). 

Our building is still fairly new and I’ve been talking to a lot of blue cards and they said they started a second sort shift for peak and they are considering wether they want to keep that shift and fire some people from both shifts/consolidate, or just fire the entire sort and leave or convert most of us on the late shift.... not a lot of information out and about, but they’ve been trying to give us updates atleast during standup..",0,t3_ehpu77,t2_5ayzic2b,fclqm50,t3_ehpu77,t5_1387r9,1577754086,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"While they are technically the same due to having the same ""contract"" terms, associates that are under the seasonal umbrella are let go before ones who ask to be temps. They're supposed to ask during the hiring process so they know who is only going to be there for peak and who wants to stay on basically. 

Also, while temps can technically be employed for a while, their base terms is for no longer than 1050 hours per assignment. They can quit and be rehired and that restarts the total hours as it's a new assignment. There's a few states that have their own laws that can change the total hour count but the most I know of is 1200 hours. One could stretch the hours out for a while if they take a lot of VTO as excused time does not count towards the total hours but generally it's only good for a max of 6-8 months if there's a lot of VTO.",0,t1_fclrblr,t2_xy05j,fclseik,t3_ehu356,t5_1387r9,1577755317,URL not found

Conversion is never a given and as others have said, based purely on business need. If your building is already staffed to meet building output requirements, yes, they are going to give people the boot. 

If that isn't in the works, then i'd say that's a blunder on the part of your OM and AM if they were in the process of training you in PS, because that's about a few months wasted on someone who they won't get any value out of...",0,t1_fckzkxr,t2_11p1ke,fcn187c,t3_ehpu77,t5_1387r9,1577800323,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The rate shown to you at a Kiosk is from a system called Adapt which tracks rates, learning curve, and DPMO (quality.)

The process by which the bottom 5% of an entire direct path (regardless of shift) are identified and given progressive write-ups is called SPPR and happens weekly.  You will not be fired the first (or second, or third) time for rate performance alone.  Your rank of 60/1400 means you are performing better than 1340 other employees.  The 75% circle means you're in the top 25% of employees, it's not tracking you to a goal that you're not meeting.  Another important thing to note is that you are not eligible for any performance based feedback until you have 160 hours in direct path.

In short, based on the data you provided, your performance is outstanding.

As for identifying possible temp to blue badge conversions, it's likely that the managers are considering rate if there are limited opportunities.   If I only have 100 slots, I'm going to do my best to convert the best employees.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Honestly i'm not sure lol, i've never attempted to get anything from the site as my location has an HR store that you can use swag bucks to purchase gear available from. Someone has mentioned on another post that I linked this to, that there is potential for this to just be a requisition site where Amazon orders gear for their specific locations, so even if you put your own payment information on there it may end up just charging the company. So i'd be wary of using the site, especially if whatever location you're at has a swag store. The only downside to the site's swag stores, is that you can't use real money there. Just play money, or electronic play money for working harder than others.

Honestly, it seems more like it is who you know, rather than how good you are. I've heard of people that never make rate getting converted and I've heard of people who were all-stars getting canned.

comment,AmazonFC,-4,The point is that it's lovely to have an employer decide whether you can speak about public information about the company or not in a critically fashion even off working time. The point is that if they so chose too they really would be able to just fire anyone identifiable on this subreddit simply for speaking about the company regardless of the nature of the topic.

comment,AmazonFC,2,Injuries typically are the fault of the employee. Because people shortcut their own safety. Does management want higher rates? Sure. But actual corporate management would tell you to never shortcut your safety regardless of the hit to your rate. And you have to be in the bottom 5% of rates for it to even matter in whether you could lose your job. And Amazon logistics operates at a loss. The only reason amazon can afford anything is the huge profits from aws and other money makers.,0,t1_fcxewhk,t2_23luoa5y,fcy5igv,t3_ejawic,t5_1387r9,1578075138,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,2,"Not sure where people keep getting the idea that Amazon operates at a loss but it really doesn't. Amazon's revenue showed a 24% increase in the third quarter following Prime Day's sales. Many analysts attribute that to Prime's shift to one day shipping. While Amazon might not be making the mass profits from years prior from the AFCs it's attributed to it's massive investment in the expansion of the Prime network this past year. This is a normal cycle for Amazon's finances. There's only so much you can squeeze out of existing infrastructure before the system is overwhelmed. 

As far as safety, it's all fine and dandy that corporate doesn't want you to risk safety but I don't see anyone from the corporate office making decisions on promotions nor terminations. At many FCs including my own if you do not make rate, especially as a white badge, you get the chopping block. The 5% isn't really implemented in my Dept. Also safety isn't actually enforced 24/7 in many places. It's all good while the big wigs are there but as soon as it's just the regular shift workers the chaos returns.",0,t1_fcy5igv,t2_54op8adg,fcy9ojz,t3_ejawic,t5_1387r9,1578076755,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,3,AMZL operates completely at a loss.. not amazon as a whole. Just amazon logistics. Like I said. Not fulfillment. Logistics. I work for corporate logistics in a projects team that is based around saving money. I see cost every day site by site. But I came from being a white badge associate and worked my way up. I thoroughly understand wanting to do well to keep your job and maybe impress some people to get into different roles and maybe promoted. But I never sacrificed my safety to do so. I wasn't even in top 35% when it came to rates and it never effected my ability to get promoted. I developed good star stories and interviewed well.

comment,AmazonFC,6,"PA!
Tom team is great if you're interested in the transportation aspect of the job, but there's less room for growth. Once you're outside with them it's difficult to work back into the building. They are gradually paying for all members to get CDL so if you're interested in ever leaving Amazon to become a driver, it's a fantastic option.

I had the same option and chose to apply and become a PA with encouragement from Tom team. The night shift L4s told me I would have better opportunity inside to advance. One person flat out told me to stay away because it's a dead end.

If it's same across the network, Tom and PAs are both considered tier 3 and will start at the same pay. Tom team shifts do tend to vary from the standard building shifts; either starting earlier or later so there's not as big of a shift change and the truck yard can always stay open.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Agreed 100%. I just hit my year mark and am pretty dissatisfied with the whole deal. I was recruited right before I graduated and brought in as an L5 with a nice salary, bonus, and RSU package. My first site was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and I was on nights. I didn't know anyone and the people I would have made friends with were all working when I was off or I was working when they were off, it was a social nightmare. 12 hour shifts, completely exhausted afterwards, slept pretty much my first day off on the ""weekends"".
I left that site bc my wife couldn't take the rural location anymore and I transfered to a metro area. Everything was fine at first at my new site and there was tons of room for promotion. At one point we had zero L6's in outbound so there were 4 open spots and still open AM spots. What does the site do, they leave the open AM spots unfilled meaning more work for us, and hire externally 6 Operations Managers. After that nearly all AMs have left, I'm looking as well and so are my counterparts. 
Amazon can be great if you are at the right FC. I lost total trust in the system within the last 2 months. I just got done with Peak, working 75 hour weeks and my Sr. Ops tells me I'm getting moved to nights from days because the Ops managers that he hired are lacking analytical skills. I'm done with it at this point.

comment,AmazonFC,5,"No, not really. I was hired on as the ISS PA (new opening FC), they knew I preferred days (I initially was going for an IT position), and they gave me Wed-Sat, I couldn't negotiate.

When the ISS PA spot was phased out 8 months later, my management team knew who I was since I had gone to all of the meetings and all that jazz, and they liked me well enough, so they requested that the powers that be keep me on their team in Inbound Stow.

It sounds like your FC is already established. I can't speak for TOM team, but the open PA spot is likely because someone is getting an additional manager, or another PA either left or got promoted. Either way, there is likely one spot open, so there's no negotiation, not even for the same department (inb4 my story above, I got really lucky).

In conclusion, I highly recommend you apply anyways. The Amazon internal transfer process is as such: 
After you apply, they will look at your work history and resume. If those pass the tests, then you will go in for an interview (you need to be decent at math for a T3). After the interview, you will get feedback (in-person feedback has a 20 minute delay for private manager discussion, phone interviews take up to a week) stating what you did well and how you could improve. Then, they will tell you whether or not you've been inclined. What that means is regardless of whether or not you get the final position (aka ""slotted""), for the next [90 days for T3, 6 months for L4+], if a position opens up somewhere else, you can apply and don't have to go through the interview process again.

Worst case scenario: you get feedback for your next interview.   
Best case scenario: you get the job",0,t1_fczfh23,t2_7jbsw,fczoa4i,t3_ejmtqz,t5_1387r9,1578105588,URL not found

PG/PA is cool and all, but you are managing half a floor (RSP KIVA), but its come in 30 minutes early, clean up stuff the previous shift left (trash, pallets, work). Do your 4Ms for the floor. Start your day. People need gloves, now they need box cutters, now we have no work. Now they are sending reactive. 2nd quarter - pick cap has gone up, add 4 pickers. 

Reactive still coming up so we cant send trash down. Everyone wants VTO. ""What's my rate?"" ICQA counts are in we need more Cycle and SR counters; oh but no one else on my floor is trained - call on radio, ""Can someone spare an X counter for an X trained associate""... ""Why is start of 3rd QTR PS SWIP at 200?"" ""Floor health is down to 72 percent, where are the amnesty techs?""

Keep in mind this is only half the day AT MINIMUM in Operations as a T3. 

TOM and transportation is a lot less muddled: check in and check out drivers, work cases, make hostler moves, perform yard audits, monitor trailer pool, CPT and wrangle chase. The thing with TOM is you are literally the backbone of the yard. Without you and this team, freight does not come in, OB packages dont get out. Major thing is you HAVE to have the mindset of working in much smaller teams and you're going to be working in outside weather conditions. 

You're going to be working in the heat. You will be working in the cold. You will be up and down. Inside outside. You will be communicating with IB/OB PA/AM/Ops/Sr. Ops.

Something that helped was crosstraining so I could take it easy on my wearable parts. Do PS or ICQA one shift, get rounded to Stow another, rotate to OB another, if PIT is an option get trained.

comment,AmazonFC,9,"I'm older, too. I have 2 recommendations, from unappealing but realistic to unrealistic but appealing:  


1) Go with it. Humans were made to move. My first warehouse job I cried myself to sleep every night and dreaded every morning. In the first 3 months I lost 40 lbs and got into the best shape I'd been in since I'd gotten discharged from the service. I decided to change my outlook. Humans are remarkably adaptive creatures. This is literally ""Turn that frown upside down"" advice and it is unappealing, but if you can change your mind, you can actually enjoy the physicality of the work.  


2) AtoZ, Resources, Job Finder and change your lot in life. Amazon is worldwide and has most of a million people. There's always openings. You are 53, so you have experience and maybe some education. Get out there and get looking. If your situation allows it, move. And if not Amazon, look elsewhere. You've survived Peak. You have abilities.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"&gt;Ok and what is minimum? Between $13.85, $14, or $15. What do other warehouses, with similar pre-requisites offer?

..And minimum wage in the US is $7.25/hour, yet Amazon pays them more than double that as starting wage. I've worked easier warehouse jobs in Canada that started at $18/hour, and that was 10 years ago!

&gt;Because I work in Canada too and Amazon's wage is over $2.50 over minimum and beats similar work in the area with no credentials needed

Again, that is garbage. The minimum wage in Canada is a joke, and a measly $2.50/hr more doesn't make much of a difference and still doesn't meet the living wage standard for any populated areas.


&gt;Also Canadian AA's get stocks and VCP which is more than the Americans get. Plus benefits which is very hard to get at a normal warehouse job.

The stock offer is a joke, because you only get 1 unit of stock when they hire you and you only actually get it if you stay for at least 2 years. The only positive thing Amazon offers is benefits that start on day 1; You get similar benefits at other warehouse jobs only they usually start after 3-months.",0,t1_fd2qo5o,t2_twjst,fd3cz2d,t3_ejawic,t5_1387r9,1578157034,URL not found

There are performance metrics that must be meant but honestly those are not really set very high IMHO. 

You will get a full lunch (but many people in IT don’t always stop working, even though you are required to). Breaks are granted but not rigidly scheduled like they are for the floor workers in most buildings.

Another big one is having a willingness to move around, even to other buildings.

As far as getting your rate up, I don't have experience in picking (trained as an AFE packer/rebinner/water spider) but I can give you some general tips at least. ""Go faster"" is definitely a valid way to do it, but not the only way. Look for ways to shave off time by eliminating excess movements - taking off 1-2 seconds from a repetitive motion or activity adds up more than you might think when you keep doing it.

At an FC the only people getting negative written feedback are people in the bottom 5% if they are not making rate. So that 57% they were talking about was probably 57% to rate.

I remember your original post and you did get some good advice there but it seems like you didn't follow it correctly. Sometimes a doctors note won't cut it and HR will want the doctor to fill out some paperwork and actually fax it to them, that way they know some random person didn't just sign some doctors note.

The only thing I can think to do is actually go to HR again and try explaining everything. Your badge is deactivated and you're not allowed to work after being terminated, but you can still talk to HR. I've seen a couple people get reinstated after being terminated by the computer but there has to be wrong doing on HRs part, like not inputting information and giving back UPT when they should have.

comment,AmazonFC,2,"You only do 1 or 2 shifts a week? Does that mean you're flex or ""fc ready"" associate, someone who isn't scheduled?

You're in a weird position if so. I train pickers (not prime now, I'm in regular FC) and overhear the details on what can or can't get a write up. Partly because sometimes with training others and projects- I can work a 60hr week and have less than 5 hrs in path to have a rate.

Less than x hrs in a day (might be different in different locations so why do details) doesn't count towards rate. Less than y hours a week and not eligible for a write up on rate. So if I pick two half days i might have a rate and be eligible for write up if I'm low. *Might*. Important to know when I'm stressing because I'm working alongside new hires and they stop me to ask questions - do i need to worry about my rate this week or no?

The logic is that my rate is meant to be an average. I'm not expected to be at/over goal every minute of the day and if I'm not picking enough hours it's luck of the draw to get a pick path that makes rate. It's logically possible you aren't working enough hours to reliably make rate. So you aren't on the list of people eligible for write up. (Note- this is a thing that the policies dictate by exact amount of time worked. I know a person who got a write up at 5.2 hours in path, under goal. Please don't argue that 5.2 hours isn't easier to make rate than 5 hrs exact- I know.)

If you wanna convert over to be a scheduled full time employee - my suggestions on rate in my facility is mostly noticing your own Achilles heel. Do you slow down when too bored? Or you head the wrong direction if your mind wanders. When you stop to talk to a buddy, glance at the time occasionally- how many minutes was that ""quick chat"", how many quick chats do you have in a shift? If you don't have a glaringly obvious problem like mobility issues or vision problems, my experience says it's usually a combination of noticing where the time goes.

Personally i *hate* walking fast back from break. It's like it un does the good of resting. So i leave the break room early so i can stroll at a slow pace.

We always had it drilled into our heads that you get so much UPT every quarter and to manage it ourselves. Also, OP said in their original post that they were informed by HR to do a medical leave if it was a serious condition, which theirs wasn't considered one. So it looks like OP just kept going deeper into the negative and thought a doctor note after the fact would help. What I'm not understanding is that OP received an email on January 1st that they had to answer to, they should have automatically been given more UPT at that point, unless OP was so negative that the extra quarter of UPT didn't matter.",0,t1_fd9lty5,t2_qi3n7,fd9zjj5,t3_ekcl9p,t5_1387r9,1578239930,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,9,"I only know a few

•TOT stands for Time Off Task, anytime you’re away from your station longer than 5 minutes you’ll start accruing this. It doesn’t become a problem unless you accrue an hour or so of this. 

•AFE stands for Amazon Fulfillment Engine, it’s the system they have in place to smoothly pack and ship out boxes as quickly as possible. You usually pack smaller items here.

•CPT stands for Critical Pull Time, this happens to an order when it’s in danger of being shipped out late to a customer. Amazon really doesn’t want this to happen so they’ll send out PA’s or PG’s to pull them and take them to be shipped out ASAP.

•AM- Stands for Area manager, they usually oversee the entire department and deal more with the numbers .

•PA- stands for Process Assistant, their your supervisors. You’ll talk to them more than your AM’s and will see them way more often. They usually deal with associates directly, it’s a good idea to be on their good side so they can put you to problem solve.

•PG- They just help out the PA with menial stuff they don’t want to do, this is what you want to ideal do to stand out from the rest.

•UPT- Unpaid Time, your lifeline. If you go negative, your most likely going to be terminated. Try to keep this above 15 hours if you want to move up.

•VET and MET- Voluntary Extra time and Mandatory Extra Time, pretty self explanatory.

•VTO- Voluntary Off Time, everyone’s favorite. You get to take a day off without using any of your time, you can only take this when they hand them out though.

•PPE- stands for Personal Protective Equipment, this one is used even outside amazon. Protective glasses, gloves, etc.

For your second question, HR and Learning are hard to get into internally as it’s competitive. I would log in on a computer onsite to see what jobs they have currently available and apply apply apply! During peak season they have seasonal positions so that’s also a good way to get your feet wet. Ambassador and Problem Solving are easier to get, but it’s all based on business need. Your best bet is to ask your PA if there are any openings, in my site they always announce these at Stand Up in the morning and after lunch. Keep an ear out and apply when they have openings, I would recommend Problem Solve if you love being on a computer and solving defects on products. If you’re more of a people person, want to know more of how Amazon is run beyond your department, and don’t mind training people the Ambassador is good but you can do both! The more you know, the better it looks in your amazon resume.

For your last question I don’t really have any advice, I’ve worked in Pick, Inventory Control/Qualify Assurance(ICQA), and Universal Receive but never Pack Singles. If you’re unsure of why you’re not doing as good as you would like then ask your PA to have an Ambassador be with you for a day to find any barriers you may have. Best of luck!

comment,AmazonFC,2,"Now that you're internal, it's going to be more difficult to advance to the positions you would have been qualified for as an external hire. 

Someone mentioned pathways, but this is only an option if you're an external hire. 

These type of situations are always tricky, because you're technically exceptionally over qualified for basic L4 roles (if you have experience in a similar environment regarding the size of the workforce you'll be over, or the blast radius in terms of responsibilities and who is effected). 

I was going to give a very long and exhaustive explanation of the path you can take, but i'm starting to realize that people with your level of education need to simply speak with your local HR and Senior leadership.

Skipping levels isn't impossible, but now that you're internal it's going to be a bit more difficult. 

Your path to a higher L6/7 role quite honestly could be like most, or it could be a lot quicker. Things change literally every few weeks from the corporate, data center and fulfillment center setting that at this point i'd rather just encourage you to go talk to your HR Business Partner and/or Senior leadership and have some 1-on-1's with them to express your desire to advance your career in Amazon, and let them know about your degree and experience. 

There are so many options within Amazon it's hard to say what your path might look like. If you don't have a problem with relocating, definitely cast your net wide. Consider anywhere from Virginia and where our new HQ will be, to Washington to California. Whether this be a traditional corporate building, data center, or another FC.",0,t3_ejyf9f,t2_11p1ke,fdb6dyi,t3_ejyf9f,t5_1387r9,1578254343,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,5,"If you have a bachelor's degree, you can apply for any position you want as long as you are in ""good standing"". Meaning no active write-ups. At some sites, you can apply for most positions without a degree but you would have to be a blue badge for two continuous years.  You having a degree helps you avoid that hurdle.  When you get a chance at work, log on to a computer, visit ""Inside Amazon"" page and search the STAR format.  Get well acquainted with the method.  From there, it's a matter of setting up mock interviews with HR and applying for positions.

I feel bad for you, but you didn't take the necessary steps that were suggested. A medical leave would have still allotted you pay. You would have learned this if you took the advice that you were given and spoke to your HR or even amcare. If you went to amcare, they would have actually taken you off the floor and directed you to go to an Amazon approved doctor to initiate the entire medical leave process....

I'm not trying to be harsh, but take this as a lesson learned. No one here is trying to screw you out of your job, quite the opposite, I don't want to see anyone unemployed when there is a very obvious route to alleviate your problem(s). 

Please reapply to Amazon whenever the cool-off period is for termination has passed, and best of luck to you.",0,t3_ekcl9p,t2_11p1ke,fddvj5m,t3_ekcl9p,t5_1387r9,1578325017,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,Just contact the recruiter and say you are contacting m them about the position by your manager.  Sounds like they are iving you the opportunity to apply for the position and get in your application for the position before it goes public and be ahead of the process which can be lengthy.  Getting the position is not a guarantee... all you have to do is pass the interview and its not a clean cut process.. just because you are being given the information about the opening.  Find out from your managers the questions and be prepared for it.  Practice and know your leadership principles of Amazon which is how the interview is based on.  Ask your manager for advice and help on preparing for the interview should you be selected to go to the next phase of your application.  Nothing is given no matter how much your manager may want you for the position.

comment,AmazonFC,2,"Oh boy, you think those are bad? Couple years back we used to have only two labels. Lithium ION and Lithium METAL... Thing is, is that you had to scan the big battery type label then scan a battery handling label. But wait, there's more! You also had to scan a badge that belonged to an associate with battery approval. This was meant to show that they inspected your package to make sure the 2 stickers were on properly. AAs would see totes full of batteries and put them back on the line to avoid tanking their rate.

Just a quick breakdown...

* Pull tote with 30-60 batteries in it (common for after Christmas).
* Scan battery
* Make box
* Scan battery type label and put on box
* Scan battery handling label and put on box
* Scan a battery approval badge
* Scan a PSLIP if applicable
* Scan sp00

I've definitely NEVER had a ""missing""..... my love of ""dunnage"" and empathy for the customer's investment causes me to NEVER forget to put it in, which surely slows my rate.  And ""overages"" can happen due to too much dunnage or tape, or even when a upgraded box override doesn't properly register. I've gotten ALL of these pack coaching messages, but the first two are the only ones I believe. The rest are rubbish.

comment,AmazonFC,1,I think i had one missing prompts. But i always see the overages. One time i barely started and Prompt says about broken sets. Im like??? What? Its just annoying.  I hate it when they put the LPN sticker above the old one and you can still see the old one sticking and when i scanned it its gonna say overages but im trying to scan the New sticker.,0,t3_elo8e6,t2_2rwm0tma,fdk1v5z,t3_elo8e6,t5_1387r9,1578493988,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Don't step down. I'm just going to assume you're a great person with a good work ethic who could find a better fitting position within Amazon. Laterally transferring to other positions as L3 is very easy. Even if you don't like the position, it's better to stick to it and add another feather to your hat, than quit now and ultimately go through the entire interview process again if you ever want to promote to L3 for another department. 

Ignore what other people have said about the ""difficulty"" of moving off of TOM team; you can transfer virtually anywhere within Amazon. 

Tough it out and look for other opportunities at your building, or another building in another department, but quitting now and that forever being on your Amazon ""records,"" so to speak, is not a good thing.",0,t3_el2qfh,t2_11p1ke,fdk4icd,t3_el2qfh,t5_1387r9,1578495855,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"They all are rated functions except maybe TO dock, but thats because thats a broad function

RC sort scans stuff to be sorted to different destinations prior to ship.

Transfer out is shipping, its 95% same process as every other form of ship, you scan things to build pallets.

TO dock- loading trailers, it could be manual wall building or driving a forklift to load pallets. They may have a rate depending on how much volume the site ships.

Inbound prep- its actually receiving but with added steps, typically very high rate similar to pack",0,t3_elnyrv,t2_ueeie,fdki8n5,t3_elnyrv,t5_1387r9,1578504373,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Its not so much transferring directly into an unrated function as it is getting thrown into a supporting role for rated functions. It varies widely between sites, but some or all of those functions may have indirect roles that help support them (lots of things need waterspiders or refilling supplies). The TO dock role could put you on a forklift which is pretty low intensity, the transfer out role could have other associates help you stack totes or cases.

In my experience though, you go to a sortable or ar sort, or sort center, or IXD which handle primarily small items everything will have rates. If you want less rated functions go to non-sorts which primarily operate PIT and deal with large items",0,t1_fdkwyw5,t2_ueeie,fdm2rwc,t3_elnyrv,t5_1387r9,1578538433,URL not found

With Rebin and Induct(somewhat), it's a lot more physically demanding but being that way makes the time go faster.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"First off, get some good insoles for your, preferably, athletic shoes.  This can do wonders.

I did singles pack for half of peak and it is very hard to make rate but you can do it!  Do they move you stations before/after lunch?  Ours you would usually switch stations at lunch, often front half to back and vice versa.  This gives you a chance to be closer to the front and ""cherry pick"" the ""good"" totes.  Look for ones with lots of aerosol cans or single smaller items.  This can get you a lot of A1 boxes that you should be able to fill very fast.  

Try to familiarize yourself with your setup and location of different boxes.  Learn all your maintenance - changing tape, SPOO labels, HAZ, water tank.

I like to grab an item, scan it and put it on the table, grab the box and form it over the top of the item (this way I can make sure it fits and get a different box if needed), place tape on bottom, flip the whole thing with item over, grab dunnage, close, tape, scan SPOO and place and toss on the line.  Now ours had automatic tape dispensers that would shoot out the bottom piece after the item scan, and the top piece after the SPOO scan.  I preferred to unplug this and press the tape button myself for a variety of reasons but for one because I think it's faster to tape the box shut and then scan the SPOO and place it on top of the tape rather than on the side of the box to not cover it.
Some managers would care, others wouldn't, but when it was busy we would sometimes pull off an extra tote or two if it was ""gold"" and that can really boost your rate. 
Work on grabbing plenty of dunnage quickly and filling the box, closing and what I would do is fill it up to where it would close tight or I might need to pop a few with the box cutter point, that way I knew it was filled.  You'll get better as you get comfortable.  Just keep trying to get better and you will, you're still very new and it takes some time to get used to it all.",0,t3_ekh2jv,t2_5eml8gan,fdmy27n,t3_ekh2jv,t5_1387r9,1578570884,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You mean ""the deal""? 

There should be, but someone who's currently in the FC could comment on it if things have changed. 

My advice to you would be not to take the deal. It sounds great, an extra $1k (taxed though) for your first peak. The catch is that you cannot work at Amazon or **ANY SUBSIDIARY OF AMAZON EVER AGAIN**

People don't seem to really grasp just how big Amazon is, and just how fast Amazon continues to expand. Amazon by no means is slowing down on that point; AWS is literally going to QUADRUPLE in the next 5'ish years, meanwhile, the FC footprint continues to expand at a rapid pace as well. To me, unless you're someone who's retiring and they don't need a job in the future, it is an extremely foolish decision to permanently exclude one of the biggest employers in the US as a potential prospect for future potential employers. 

You don't know what the future holds. You might end up losing your job for any freak reason; would you want to not have the chance to get a job at one of your biggest and simplest employment options? Not only that, but the career options in Amazon are exhaustively extensive. Your career most likely overlaps somewhere in Amazon, and at some point, you very well might consider seeking a higher level of employment here at Amazon.",0,t3_em9vt6,t2_11p1ke,fdn898e,t3_em9vt6,t5_1387r9,1578579947,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Like another individual said, you should hound your AM about it. If you're a PA, you should be recommending people as well. 

In my opinion no one who's seasonal that isn't positioned for conversion should be PS. A good problem-solver won't become efficient until a few *months* into the process. Unless all they're doing is the absolute bare minimum with no responsibilities, then yes, months, and those months will be wasted on someone who ends up being let go, and then you're at square one.


Be proactive about putting people forward, or seeking people out. As the PA you should be interacting with your associates more so than your AM. If you can't find a single soul that you deem competent enough, I would say there is equal blame to go around. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you're new to the role and probably don't have a good feel for everyone, that's entirely understandable, but I had seen it plenty of times where people who did not deserve the position (even blue-badge employees) were given it over others simply because they put themselves forward, and then we got stuck with truly incompetent individuals. 

Don't be afraid to tell your AM ""no"" either, and involve your OM. If your AM and OM give a damn, they will care about one of the most important functions of an FC regarding OB, and who is staffed in that role.",0,t3_em85my,t2_11p1ke,fdn931h,t3_em85my,t5_1387r9,1578580544,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Not all sites have PS PA's. 

Yes, your best option would be to speak with your leadership team and express your interest in promoting. Being open to positions that aren't *just* PA related is good as well. 

Ask about other sites in your area and figure out how willing you are to travel- are you willing to travel? If that's the case, then definitely broaden your search to other sites. A lot of people commute, some people far more than others. Don't be discouraged if it's an hour away. My suggestion is not for everyone, but the point is that you do have options. 

Figure out what other sites are in your area, filter by L3 when searching the site name, and figure out where you want to go. 

Beyond that, when you do have a 1-on-1 with leadership, perhaps request mock interviews (you can have a mock interview with your L4 AM and your L7 Senior Ops, totally up to you and their willingness, which they damn well should be willing, because that's part of their job is to advance the people under them).

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Counterpoint Rant. Depending on staffing they overload some of the people doing waterspidering. I have also seen some people just be lazy. When I was in outbound pack I was put to waterspider every day I worked for several weeks on end. That was the case with most of the waterspiders in the fulfillment center I worked. Most people did not volunteer to waterspider and they all hated it so you can tell by their work stations.
**MY EXPERIENCE WARNING** 
Lifting piles of boxes  repeatedly all day is a bitch especially into the second level of the holders. It is a pain unless you are very strong which was not the case for me in the beginning. I was able to pack decently by the point I was put to waterspider so it wasn't me just being incredibly weak. There's also people who are absolutely annoying about turning their lights on when they were only missing a few boxes.  I would have to ask them what they needed since it was not obvious by the amount of boxes they had. You would think them pushing the light caused them to receive sexual orgasms like rats hooked up to electrical stimulation devices. There was also constant supply issues to the point where I would have to go all the way to the docks to get the pallets of boxes or else they would not be stocked all day. Just like how you're dependent on the waterspider to have their shit ready the waterspider depends on noninventory to have theirs ready.

For me I have a ticket queue and ask people to put their requests there. Honestly I usually prioritize by who is asking. If the GM ask me for something I drop my stuff and do what he wants.  Typically I do the things for myself first to make sure I get my things with deadlines done. For example IRDR needs to be done thursday but the macro I'm working on dosen't so I do IRDR first. If you ever feel like you dont know what to prioritize you should ask your manager to decide what is more important. Icqa is here to support the health of the building/inventory first and then the managers second.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Yes some waterspiders suck, but this is really a side effect of managers that suck at correctly staffing indirect roles. 

Every PSolver/waterspider is costing the building money without producing profit.  While this is a required expense and not staffing can cause huge issues, the push is always going to be to minimize the number of indirects while maximizing the production rate.  This had two direct effects:

1.  When there is an employee that kicks ass and hustles as a spider, they're probably a great packer with a great rate, too.  Young managers (Most AMs) are going to say ""Why would I pull them off to stock boxes when there's 20 people with rates that are 30% lower?"" In short, they overlook the impact of a great waterspider on process flow because it's harder to measure their impact on a floor than the extra 500 units that are going to get packed by keeping the people that bust their ass on a station.

2. Staffing indirect roles is an art form that's difficult to master.  Most AMs only understand the basics that more indirects means lower TPH (profitability).  That means that, if their Ops/Sr Ops is very cost focused and driven, they're going to err on the understaffing side which means that you have as few as half the spiders you need.  I don't care how great your hustle, you're not one-manning 10 walls for 4 hours without dragging ass at some point, missing a restock, or taking 10 minutes to get through a half-dozen andons.

In short, it's rarely as simple as ""waterspiders suck."" Next time you see one struggling, ask a PA if you can swap with them and see what barriers they're dealing with that night.",0,t3_emo333,t2_fwza6,fdtkfn5,t3_emo333,t5_1387r9,1578718042,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,2,"I think it depends on department needs and how your facility runs.

For example, I was a tier 1 working RT 6:30PM-7:00AM and when I was promoted, I became a stow PA which starts at 6:00pm. I spoke with 2 managers and HR which both confirmed I could keep the same schedule. A new OPS manager (manager's manager) came on a month later and she told me I had to start coming in at 6:00pm. 

I specifically told them I could not because of school and traffic. I spoke with HR and they told it's the business needs. That I should try to transfer to a new shift. They made no effort to accommodate my school. So I demoted myself.

Another PA just got shift transfer approved no questions asked which also pissed me off.

You may be able to create a school accommodation that checks of ""Cannot Work Overtime,"" that way you'll be able to have excused reason for not working MET.

Definitely talk to HR before applying as when you become a tier 3, sometimes you won't even keep your own schedule.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Contrary to what some have stated, L2 does exist, but it's generally implemented where there's a justifiable business need. If the blast radius of a job usually requires L3, but they're able to stretch out the leveling guidelines to lower it and accommodate for an L2, they will simply create an L2 role for any job title within Amazon. AWS Logistics has L2 for Logistics Specialists globally, and DC tech positions have been looking to implement L2 as well. In all roles, whether that be FC L2 HR, AWS L2, or anywhere else, your duties and permissions are going to be much fewer than your seniors. 

People who are L2 generally shouldn't be L2 for that long, since quite honestly it's an entry level that might as well exist to test the competency of an individual, as well as providing a work-around for the fact that you can't skip levels in most circumstances.  

Pay across Amazon, as others have said, is based on cost of living. Pay will also vary based on teams/orgs; even though you might be an L3 in one org within Amazon, you might laterally transfer to another which is paid almost double what you currently are being paid. 

If you ever see L3 positions in other orgs/teams/companies within Amazon, always feel free to reach out to the hiring manager if it's involving skipping levels from T1 to L3, because there's a chance you might be able to skip to L3, or have the position downgraded to L2.",0,t3_en4gno,t2_11p1ke,fdz2g9k,t3_en4gno,t5_1387r9,1578785981,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"No not all PTO, but they would have needed the max. Assuming their last day was the 18th the next three would have been off. That means for the 22nd through 24th they would have used at least 30 hours PTO. Possibly 33 and maybe even 44 to cover an MET shift. If they end peak blackout after Christmas he could switch to Vacation time at that point, but I’d imagine he would have used around 40 or 44 which is near the max you can have. Then he would have needed the max saved up vacation time to get him all the way until know.

Provide them with the first day of absence and your return to work date.  They will ask you a few additional questions and will send you some papers to have filled out by your physician.  Any time that you have used while out should be given back to you.  Short term disability for medical provides you with a certain percentage of pay while out.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If you want to just become like every other AM, then you're already positioned well enough. Skipping levels seems to be more difficult nowadays, so your path would be to promote to T3 PA, and then it's quite honestly up to your building if there is an opening and they choose to actually promote you to L4; or you could look at other buildings (you'll have more options this way, but less clout with leadership).

If you have a degree in engineering, you are positioned better than most (not sure who told you otherwise, because they are dead wrong). If I were you (although I don't know specifically what type of engineering your background/degree is in), i'd look outside the FC and even consider relocating. Do you want to work in Lab126 in the CA Bay Area making a fat ass paycheck? Do you want to work perhaps in corporate at HQ2 or Seattle? Do you want to work as an actual Engineer in Data Center Engineering? 

Depending on your level of experience and what your degree actually is can definitely broaden your options. At the very least you are better positioned for an L4 AM role. 

Speak with your AM about it, if that takes you nowhere and he/she doesn't know anything, speak with your L6 Operations Manager. If that takes you nowhere, request a 1-on-1 with your L7 Senior Ops. A lot of people as T1 can have a 1-on-1 with them, a lot of people have. Let them know about your degree and that you have an interest in moving up.

One AM showed me their resume and it was good (multiple opportunities at internships and volunteering). I'm hoping to make it to corporate one day while I'm still somewhat young. Any advice on getting there with a degree in Computer Science even though you work for Amazon as Tier 1 currently? Do you reccomend going for PA first before AM?,0,t1_fedu250,t2_11ls3u,fedun9q,t3_eojvgw,t5_1387r9,1579020254,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Great degree, that'll definitely be advantageous to whatever position you apply to in terms of growth. If you have no issue with traveling/relocating, consider applying to positions that require relocation. There are some positions that i'm starting to see pop up that are intern positions that are open to internal employees as well. 

You should know GPA doesn't matter; once you're in college no one gives a shit about high school GPA. As long as you're good at what you do and you can demonstrate that, you'll be good. 

The only thing I forgot to mention is that finding positions as an employee will be more difficult if the position is a higher level. You can get hired straight into any level role- I mean that's a given I guess- but once you're an internal employee it becomes far more difficult to jump into a position that might be 4 or even 6 levels higher than your own. 

Speak with your leadership and let them know about your education. Update your LinkedIn so accurately represent who you are, and maybe even reach out to people on the network. Access one of the computers available to you as an employee, go to jobfinder.amazon.com and search for positions using keywords for positions you think apply to you. Once you find something you think interests you, click on the hiring manager, and this should direct you to their phonetool profile. If it's a regional/director level blue-badge as the hiring manager, drill down into their direct-reports for people with the job title you're applying for (you could even just search that on phonetool). 

If you have Chime (anyone can request to have access to their Amazon email, when they do this, it'll give you access to Chime to message anyone on the Amazon network) you can always message these people to get an idea of what the job will be like, and any advice they might have for you. 

Sounds like a lot, sounds like you might bother people, but the reality is 9 out of 10 people in this company are going to be more than willing to share their knowledge with you and help you move up.",0,t1_fedrt8p,t2_11p1ke,fedydyu,t3_eojvgw,t5_1387r9,1579022504,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Yeah it stinks having to struggle to move up internally, but it is what it is. I did manage to get my degree before starting at Amazon, so it's not like I got it while working. I was trying for tech jobs before that are local to me, but most wanted me to have more experience. Due to desperation for college loans needing to be paid soon, I took tier 1 role just to help make ends meet. Sadly, relocating is out of the question at the moment and problems in my home life are preventing me from doing that (parents need my help due to their medical situations). That's why I'm hoping to move up here at my current FC to stay local and help put more financially. Just seems like it's going to be very rough to get there. I'm getting back into tech side projects in Web Development to hopefully land something else as time goes on. Experience is a real knockout for jobs anymore. It's getting a bit crazy in the tech world (some entry level positions near me want 2 years experience in particular languages or frameworks).",0,t1_fedydyu,t2_11ls3u,fee0b5k,t3_eojvgw,t5_1387r9,1579023684,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Well you're in a good place to start off then. A lot of positions within Amazon will almost always require you either have experience, or a degree. AWS VP even recently said in an All Hands that he would prefer we hire and promote people that are more attuned to what makes someone a great employee, rather than the person who might be more technically ""qualified,"" if the latter doesn't possess the leadership/character traits that Amazon is looking for. Amazon is changing quite a bit, so don't be discouraged about the experience side of things. 

Speak with your leadership, let them know you want to move up; unfortunately the saying ""it's not what you know, it's who you know"" does play a role to a degree; having the backing of your leadership to promote to T3 or even straight to L4 is big. In the meantime, I would definitely be looking at jobfinder to search for positions in your area.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I know of a two people who became an AM in one to two years. 

Went from a Days Problem Solver into a Nights Ship Dock PA, then made it into a Day's AFE PA, then a Data analyst tier 3 and finally became an AM. Took him a year.

The other guy first became an ambassador then applied for a seasonal learning tier 3 until he got permanent after 2018 peak, and became an PA for nights and got an offer to relocate to another state to be an AM for a new building. Took him about 2 years.

If you're internally sadly in most cases you won't get promoted from a tier 1 straight towards a Tier 4. Best best is to either quit and apply for an AM spot or work up the ladder in which case it can take a year if not more to get that spot.

Enter in those keywords verbatim and it should make it very simple for you to find the positions i'm referencing.

You're lucky in terms of where you're located, since AWS is in your region. Check them all out, and don't feel like just because you don't hit every qualification that you shouldn't apply.

Both routes have their positives and negatives. If you're someone with a specific degree and a specific field of expertise, applying externally to obtain that role might be far more simple. 

You'll miss out on a lot of experiences in the FC and such, which I think is valuable, but a degree is and always will be the fast-track to these positions. 

My argument has always been that by the time you're ready for an L4 role, you would have spent the same amount of time as you would have pursuing a degree (probably less). 

Once you're internal you can't apply through external job listings. You'll have to quit and apply.",0,t1_fefunfj,t2_11p1ke,fegluab,t3_eojvgw,t5_1387r9,1579096728,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"As far as I know, a PA is technically supposed to be shipclerking. At my warehouse, we typically had PA's on this position but started training associates to do it. We ended up with too many PA's for various reasons on the ship dock and ended leaving the shipclerk as an associate vs getting a PA to do it. There was often talk of cutting back on PA's on the dock and filling certain roles PA's typically performed with associates who were wiling to do the training, but it fell through to some extent. Overall, I don't see it affecting your prospects on promotion, though like all things, your connections with upper management matters, and being stuck at the ship desk can make it harder to shine in the eyes of those that matter vs being on the floor and involved in the front lines where management may see you more often and speak with you about the day's plan or w/e.",0,t3_epcfj1,t2_a98rf,feilcll,t3_epcfj1,t5_1387r9,1579141217,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"They get together with managers from your other local facilities such as other FCs and SCs that are local to you. They'll make a group decision when to if and when to shut down. If there's heavy snowfall guaranteed, they'll likely shut down the entire FC for that time period until roads are made passable again. Now if the FC is in operation at that time, they'll shut down and people will leave early and the next shfit will be cancelled. 

If it's something like light snowfall, they'll likely give 1-3 hour grace period for you to come in. Perhaps you live out in BFE on a minor tertiary road and that light snowfall isn't cleared for long enough that you can't make your shift. Just document it and submit to your HR. Helps to chime your AM/PA as well. 

Overall, most managers will be quite lenient when it comes to severe weather, especially when it's snow. Just call your FC and check the weather hotline to see if you're closed or if shifts are delayed and so on.",0,t3_epgqkm,t2_xy05j,fejbxev,t3_epgqkm,t5_1387r9,1579166286,URL not found

A ship clerk is glued to their computer and radio the entire shift. Their entire job is to ensure that CPTs get out on time. That it. Usually the CPT chasers work as the hands of the ship clerk as the clerk cannot leave their computer for longer then 10 minutes without something bad happening.

PA is all about the people - your people. Ship clerk is only about CPTs.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"So, there is a budget, but it doesn't have a ton do with VTO. There's an amount of work that's expected to be done on each shift, based on historical data and general customer trends. If you only need to have X amount of people working, then the rest can be VTO'd. This has the double benefit of not having people standing around and saving some payroll money on top. VTO is, obviously, completely voluntary. No one is forcing anyone to leave, it's just that they don't need you in path, so if you wanna go, you can. It usually isn't a problem finding enough people who want to leave though lol. If everyone did stay, they'd find SOMETHING for everyone to do. The amount of people on  the shift is already built into the budget.",0,t3_eq4cvb,t2_751w8,fenukbw,t3_eq4cvb,t5_1387r9,1579291010,URL not found

After, they take all the expenses and see how it aligns with their revenue. There is usually an expected baseline of what your margin should be between the two.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"**IATA airport code**

An IATA airport code, also known as an IATA location identifier, IATA station code or simply a location identifier, is a three-letter geocode designating many airports and metropolitan areas around the world, defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The characters prominently displayed on baggage tags attached at airport check-in desks are an example of a way these codes are used.

The assignment of these codes is governed by IATA Resolution 763, and it is administered by the IATA's headquarters in Montreal. The codes are published semi-annually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory.IATA also provides codes for railway stations and for airport handling entities.

comment,AmazonFC,0,Well let's see the mark they say they stop at for us here is 4. MEANING people who want to get converted ARENT gonna get 4 right ? So they will have either JUST UNDER 3.5 or maybe even less. SO if they have only a few spots open which I cant imagine they'd have to many available after just converting but now they have a rehire so maybe a few if any? If you REALLY want to be converted it will show in your points and the less you have the better it looks and they DO in fact look at points. I talk to EVERYONE at the Integ. Desk every year(usually the same peps) and points do matter when it comes down to the last few spots. But here I will go and edit my comment sense so many people seem to think differently. But atleast you have the sense to not argue about it like some dumbasses on reddit. CLEARLY POINTS MATTER WHY TF ELSE WOULD THEY USE THEM. BUT arent the ONLY thing. But yes.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I'm just guessing based on your shift schedule that the DS you're starting at is an MCO (Multi Cycle Operation). This means two sort cycles per day. First (and typically largest one) starts around 2015h and ends around 0415h. Second sort (or cycle, therefore called C2 Sort) typically starts around 0715h and ends around 1015h. 

These times are all very different depending upon the DS volume and type of cycles... But if I were a betting man, I'd guess your shift to be the C2 Sort (which also consists of doing your own Pick &amp; Stage). P&amp;S is individuals building the van / Flex routes after the sort is complete. It's a fun shift, since the sort is only 3 hours. P&amp;S only takes 90 min. And the last hour is usually VTO or Floor Reset. In my opinion (and not just bc I run a C2 Sort) it's the best part of the DS experience bc of the various tasks completed each shift.",0,t1_feu664a,t2_lgxrulq,feusoqe,t3_eqjnhk,t5_1387r9,1579389558,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"What type of facility are you at? Pack singles at a AR non sortable facility is boring as F and you will probably end up wanting to get the rope after two weeks. But since you seem to be at a AR sortable facility maybe it is a different experience there.

I have not stowed, but stowing seems way more stressful than pick. Not having to worry about bin size and overstuffed pods makes picking pretty stress free. Rate for pick to tray (singles) is around 230 at my facility and you can quite easily hit 300+ pretty casually when not in peak. The only thing stressful about pick is keeping 100% quality because it can be tedious making sure you do not generate any false pick shorts. When your on tray and having to scan each item one by one since the pod will release can be quite annoying. However, when your picking cart and can scan stuff in the bin, since you release the pod, it is quite easy but then your dealing with all the big and heavy crap.

One advantage to pack singles would that it may be easier to get into problem solve if that is something you are interested in. In the past 5 months I have not seen anyone from pick ever get moved to problem solve. They have trained like 5-7 people for problem solve in that time and they have always pulled people from pack for that.",0,t3_erm524,t2_4dfmxb31,ff4n2xb,t3_erm524,t5_1387r9,1579567610,URL not found

Also, getting to see people’s orders is a bonus too because hen I picked I always wondered if two weird things went together etc. Sorting in AFE is a single man per line job, no socializing.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The two most important skills for an AM are multitasking and time management.

Most AMs fail because they cannot prioritize. You can do many things and be successful, you can not do many things and still be successful; but if you cannot manage your time effectively then you will fail. Guaranteed.

Being an AM is like being a juggler. You will have many balls in the air at any given moment... the trick is to make sure you catch them all on time. I am not saying obsess one one or two deliverables and ignore the rest. I am saying to keep notes, know when your deliverables are due and have a plan of action to get them all out on time.

Tricks and tips: ask questions and seek help. Seriously. You would not believe the wealth of information your longtime PAs and the support staff have which can streamline some of your more onerous tasks. Your support staff is literally there to support you; make full use of that resource.

Another tip: for the love of all of the deities above and below listen to your indirects. Especially your water spiders. Now take what they are saying with a grain of salt, but your water spiders know how their small section of your department is running better then anyone else. LISTEN to them. If you hear a common theme from your spiders week in and week out chances are you have a rather large problem on your hands.",0,t3_ery8ni,t2_o3j7j,ff71lia,t3_ery8ni,t5_1387r9,1579639313,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Labor tracking is a way to keep track of what associate is doing what if they aren't in a direct, rated path. I'm a PA in pack singles. My packers do not get labor tracked because the pack all does it for us; it shows when they are or aren't scanned into their station, if they're currently packing, how long they're away, etc. 

Positions like the waterspiders that stock the stations or tote runners collecting empty totes obviously aren't doing anything that a computer can track. They get labor tracked to show what they spent the shift doing.

It's a way to help track TOT too. We have had people that clock in and leave, so they end up what we call black bar. It's supposed to all be done and coded by a certain hour of shift. Being labor tracked isn't a negative and if you've noticed you haven't been you should ask to be.",0,t3_es4tpo,t2_11jv66,ff7x300,t3_es4tpo,t5_1387r9,1579660413,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,What everyone else has said about self-assigning. Although if it's been this long and you haven't been reprimanded by the AMs in that department or especially your own then chances are they know you are there and it's ok. It's not like you aren't labor tracked and also I'm sure your AM is aware your are there. Just to be on the safe side check in with your AM. If they do try to give some you some kind of reprimand just tell them how did THEY let it happen? Was your manager not aware of your absence in the department while clocked in? Was the other team just taking advantage of your labor and didn't notify your AM? So many other people above you had to either be neglectful or incompetent for it to be going on this long. Also it's not like you were there screwing around. The self assigning thing is more for people that are being insubordinate and want to not work or do what they want rather than their job. Yours seems more like a misunderstanding.,0,t3_es1w65,t2_16e5ps2s,ff827fp,t3_es1w65,t5_1387r9,1579664050,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Couple of things to say:

1) Learn how to work all process paths in your department. Nothing looks worse than having a manager manage a department not knowing how to properly pick/pack etc... 

2) When overloaded with work, grab a station and help out. It shows your associates that you're willing to give them a hand when things get tough.  It goes a long way when trying to get respect from your associates. 

3) Someone else said it but listen to your water spiders and problem solvers. They've been there longer than you and know how the system works. Especially water spiders, they get overworked compared to any other indirect jobs and are the first to get cut when indirect needs to be lowered. 

4) Reward those that do hard work. Training them in indirect roles, giving them first priority in VTO when available, gift cards, and etc... A happy employee is a more productive employee.",0,t3_ery8ni,t2_3z3a82p8,ff83fzt,t3_ery8ni,t5_1387r9,1579664963,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Work-life balance is definitely an issue, but it's not impossible. 

\-Manage your time. Know when your shit is due, and get it in as fast as possible. Keep notes, make a spreadsheet, whatever you have to do. If you do this, you should be able to get out of there pretty shortly after the shift ends. If you fall behind, your 12 hours shift could easily become 14+ hours.

\-Don't let Amazon control your life. As a salaried position, there are definitely going to be weeks where they have you come in extra, that's expected. But don't come in extra willingly if you ever want a life outside of that. There are AMs I see almost every day, regardless of if it's their shift or not. If you make work your only thing in life, you're going to have a bad time. 

\-Remember that as a BHN nights employee, you will have *normally* 4 days off. Granted, it's not the weekend, so a ""normal"" night life may be out of the question. But there are definite advantages to this. Plus 4 days is usually enough time to flip your schedule back and forth if you need to do things during the day. Enjoy your non-crowded grocery stores and movie theaters.",0,t3_es4krn,t2_751w8,ff8wlyv,t3_es4krn,t5_1387r9,1579698494,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Excellent points made. I’m currently an AM on BHNs. I actually don’t mind the schedule. In my opinion the type of employees who work this schedule tend to be more focused, thus why we consistently rank as the top performing shift in our department. Outside of work, a thriving social life can be a challenge, but other than that I find it’s a lot easier to run errands, goto the gym, golf, take classes, etc. You just need to adjust your lifestyle to the schedule, until you’re moved.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Strongly suggest blackout curtains. You can get temps at any home improvement store. Get both the permanent and the temps. You'll realize at some point that a window you didn't think was a problem actually is- grab the temp out of the closet and it goes up by adhesives on the glass itself. Just paper so you can cut to fit any thing.

Get some melatonin. Don't use it habitually! Very bad to get dependant on it. Good to use sporadically to encourage your body to think x time is bed time.

Have two sets of lights you use at home depending on time. You *need* bright light in your personal morning to help trigger wakefulness. You need to have dimmer at bed time.

Set night light/blue light filter settings on anything you can personalize the time on.

Take care of yourself. Find a primary care physician asap, preferably one with an email address or online booking options so you can contact them whenever without having to make phone calls at your personal midnight.",0,t3_es4krn,t2_m4oau,ff91bnq,t3_es4krn,t5_1387r9,1579702360,URL not found

UK here, did temp WHS Specialist and currently work for WHS  


Here, L4 Specialist is salaried, usually though it is lower pay than AM, same for the next step (L5 manager) unless you have previous experience that you are bringing to the table.   


Stress wise Specialist is better, as AMs are mostly dealing with shifts, having to manage people, and generally be the point of contact for a large amount of employees. Also, Specialist has more support from their department and manager.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I have worked nights for 10 years with different companies and BHN with Amazon for awhile.

1 - use your support staff. Generate a repore with your support teams, know who to go to with what problems and seek help early. Doing so can preempt many issues which will keep you to stay late.

2 - have the right attitude going into it. BHN is, like it or not, the tail being wagged by the dog - not a full and equal partner of any of the day shifts. Expect to have limited exposure to higher management and for limited oversight provided you are hitting your metrics.

3 - to follow on #2 - BHN IS AN OPPORTUNITY. Yes we are the clean up crew. And yes, we have greater freedom to learn and expand our roles then any other shift. Use that opportunity.

4 - be compassionate to your associates and to yourself. BHN has the full gamut of people, some are awesome, some less so. Use compassion in your dealings with them. But also be compassionate to yourself. If you need a day off then take it. Everyone working nights feels the same pains. We all know what it is like to wake up at the equivalent of 1am to go to a dentist appointment, or grocery shopping at what feels like 11pm. Do not feel like you need to provide justification to have a life. Take the time owed you and let your associates take theirs.",0,t3_es4krn,t2_o3j7j,ff9bwhv,t3_es4krn,t5_1387r9,1579709445,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Work-life balance? Lol! If your personal social life is dependant on having nights and weekends off then I wish you good luck especially as an AM. You are either going to have to change things around in your life to make both work or just suffer through it and like the other person said change to a shift that's more favorable to you ASAP. I've been on BHN for 2 years and for me it works. I'm not a day person at all. I just had go to front half days for peak to help them out and I was miserable the whole time. Having weekends off is overrated for me, my sleep on my days off is the same as work anyway, everything is less crowded during the week, if I have to do something during the work week I can do it before work or after instead of arriving late or leaving early. I sleep better during the day as well. After working both shifts I can definitely say the night are more focused and alert and generally more fun for some reason especially bhn and the weekend nights teams. Also most people on nights want to be there to make money and keep a job so you'll get some hard good workers there. Everyone else is so entitled about their days off that when MET is called they are the ones to bitch and complain the most while most of the other teams I mentioned don't care as much.",0,t3_es4krn,t2_16e5ps2s,ff9qozd,t3_es4krn,t5_1387r9,1579718884,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Theoretically yes dependant on where you live. I don't know about other states it's at will employment meaning employers can let you go an any moment with or without cause. Granted that doesn't mean they don't have to give a reason for unemployment purposes so really what employer is going to just let people go for no reason and pay that other than temps or seasonals. Ive not seen many seasonals at my FC being let go at the end of the season. Most that meet the criteria get converted, the rest either quit or are terminated for write-ups or attendance points. The ones that are let go at the end but not terminated probably just had too many points or 1 too many write ups but again it's not for no reason. Now I'm not saying that if they are trying to downsize that won't get stricter on things to get rid of some people especially TOT and quality even more so after peak or maybe an AM wanting to cut some people and having them under a microscope and throwing the policy book at them any chance they have but isn't that true with almost any company/employer.",0,t3_esc1ii,t2_16e5ps2s,ff9sbf3,t3_esc1ii,t5_1387r9,1579720140,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I was in a similar situation recently but my HR team really wasn't trying to help out too much. Escalate escalate escalate. I requested a hardship transfer to our PT pattern (weekends 11hrs 18.5/hr). Reduced time isn't a major hit cause you get paid more. The difference normally comes out to be around 30 or so bucks per paycheck. Not sure what your degree is in but I can speak from experience, a full time work and school load is unsustainable. Eventually it'll catch up with you and when shit hits the fan it's hard to recover from especially regarding student loans/Pell grants if you don't meet your SAP requirements. 

I would recommend, downgrading to PT for work (if school is the priority) and try to see if you can snatch a second job on campus PT. It'll probably not pay as well as Amazon but together with a PT shift at Amazon it might make the pay cut hurt just slightly less. Alternatively you may be able to take PLOA but that means no pay for missed time.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Yep. Old GM then (who's now Dir. OPS. NAFC) actually listened back then and was like:

""Fuck it - the people want it!""

And then someone from Reg or Corp heard and was like: ""Nope.""

So then they took it away - then they brought it back as an Unpaid Day Off.

Back in 2017 they changed the way SWAGs were awarded - the old system was ANYONE who did 105-110 was awarded 2 SWAGs. 

The new way when they changed it was only the top 10 percent were awarded SWAGs. 

So let's do the quick math. Let's say you were that good and your pacing was right on par to hit 106 percent every week. 

That comes out to 2 SWAG every week. 

2 SWAG (every week) times 50 (weeks) comes out right at 100 SWAG. 

Take that same ideology to the newer way we knew it as with only the top 10 percent of each department getting SWAG. 

Now that pool of eligible recipients narrows even more. So you performed your direct process path and came in below 10 percent  - EVEN if you hit above 105, yeah you get shit. 

That's how stingy Amazon is with their work force.",0,t1_ffdypko,t2_13x5gv,ffe06q4,t3_et1d8s,t5_1387r9,1579833311,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You most likely won't get an L6 offer, very unlikely in fact. Depending on how experienced your recruiter is can affect what he/she thinks is more experience than anyone they've seen. Generally, unless you have experience managing several dozen other employees in an operation as big as Amazon, you probably won't get an L5 offer. 

L4 AM is going to suck ass, but that's the nature of the FC, even for L6's I had sometimes seen them pull 18 hour shifts. If you are given an offer for L4 and you think you'll want to stay at Amazon, take the offer. The experience you'll gain here is unlike any other job, and you'll be presented with more opportunity than most people know. Amazon is vast, and growing quite literally every single day. As L4 you'll have far more upward mobility, and shouldn't restrict yourself only to the FC. 

You could go to AWS, or the corporate side of Amazon, maybe you want to join one of our subsidiaries. Do you like to travel? There are teams within Amazon where probably three quarters of their job related duties is traveling across the America's. Do you like tech? Amazon has tech related labs and expanding data centers being built virtually 24/7. 

tl;dr- depending on the type of person you are, an AM may or may not be the position for you. Within 2-3 years you could definitely climb to L6 if you are aggressively pursuing it; I would simply encourage you to think bigger than just the FC, and take it as a learning experience while you seek out your next role.",0,t3_esk6q8,t2_11p1ke,fff7ojk,t3_esk6q8,t5_1387r9,1579877785,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I'm in AWS, which is technically considered corporate, but not corporate in the traditional sense that I'm in a glass building- I came from the FC as well.

It's not difficult at all. What will be difficult is finding a position that suits your degree or passion. 

Landing roles in the FC is significantly easier since all you need are general degrees for Operations positions, or for the few who start as T1 and climb to L7, sometimes no degree even works.

Are you interested in Lab126 and software development roles? You'll probably need a degree or an exceptional amount of experience. Are you interested in recruiting? Perhaps an HR background and education will be helpful.

That's the tip of the ice burg. 

How transfers are handled is much smoother now, but will probably depend on your FC and how familiar they are with cross-org transfers; mine took over a month. 

The advise I have for you is to keep your options open, and your search broad. Amazon is enormous, especially on the AWS/corporate side. Gaming, music, labs, data centers, the list goes on.

The thing I always tell people that reject certain shifts, only to have them filled, and then be upset about this, is that there is a long line of people wanting to work at Amazon, if you're given an opportunity (even though it might be a shitty shift at first), don't pass it up.

There will be other opportunities, Amazon is expanding all the time. Always monitor the job postings and be ready!

Nights can suck, I know it, but transfers are always an option as a blue badge. You can also always transfer to other sites for better shift opportunities once you get hired.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I was referred by another person who had transferred from the FC as well. I don't have a degree. 

What i've been telling people is what the VP of Infrastructure Operations said at our All Hands a few weeks ago; qualifications don't always matter, and they would rather take someone with Amazon leadership qualities than a person with certificates and degrees that doesn't have Amazon leadership qualities. This is honestly the truth, and you'll see it a lot in certain areas. Many, *many* people started off as temps and all converted to blue badge, for some roles that people go to school to get degrees in tech, engineering, and even the financial/purchasing side of Amazon. 

People have this thought that AWS is just a bunch of geeks sitting around in cubicles programming, but that is the furthest from the truth. While it's part of it, you have our ever-expanding data centers that are looking for people to fill our engineering tech roles, our data tech roles, the physical cabling and networking infrastructure, logistics, and many other areas. 

All of those roles I just mentioned you can get into without a degree (with maybe the exception of engineering; most of the guys in engineering that i've met were actually techs for nuclear subs in the US Navy, so that should give you some perspective as to who is filling those roles, but it's not impossible) or experience. Obviously you should have a general level of knowledge (for example... if you want to be a data tech, you should have basic fundamental knowledge of what a CPU is, motherboard, RAM, PSU, what is POST, very basic knowledge of Linux. 

That's just an example. All of these roles have people that are experts at their job and they/we are always willing to teach people who have the aptitude to excel. 

When and if you get into any of these positions, you'll start to rub shoulders with people in other more traditional ""corporate"" jobs, that can indefinitely lead you to a cubicle or desk in a giant glass box, if that's your ultimate goal. 

tl;dr because I know this is a bit of a winded post- AWS is expansive, and you have many options that will help you in going down the corporate path, via avenues that aren't traditionally corporate roles. You will acquire in immense amount of knowledge that you cannot find anywhere else, so don't overlook roles that might not sound appealing to you, because I can 100% guarantee you there is so much opportunity to cross-train and rub shoulders with people in other departments that you can eventually laterally transfer into.",0,t1_ffs67lb,t2_11p1ke,ffsdpr5,t3_eutqpu,t5_1387r9,1580179232,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Yeah, it sounds like you could potentially get into the purchasing side of corporate that deals with ordering and such for many different areas of AWS. Then again I don't have a degree in your field, so it's hard to say. 

One piece of advise, if you *can* downgrade to L4 or something for an IC (individual contributor) role, I would go for it. Sure, you'll be going ""backwards,"" but the people you will meet and the relationships you will form are worth far more than just a single level. From where I sit, i've already rubbed shoulders with our global process owners who normally sit in Seattle. Did I think I would be telling someone, face to face, at that level that their tools and analytics dashboard are crap and how they can improve them? Nope, but i'm glad I stuck with this role, because time and time again you will meet people who will probably remember you in the future, should your paths ever cross again, and that will be beneficial to your endeavors. 

So, point being, if you have an MBA, leverage that and your experience, and don't be afraid to take positions you probably didn't consider before, because it is a virtual guarantee that you will get to meet people you would never have met had you not taken the position. 

In the other post I outlined a few of those roles that you could potentially apply for, even though your degree has nothing to do with them.",0,t1_ffsahly,t2_11p1ke,ffsegv3,t3_eutqpu,t5_1387r9,1580179737,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I was referred by another person who had transferred from the FC as well. I don't have a degree.

What i've been telling people is what the VP of Infrastructure Operations said at our All Hands a few weeks ago; qualifications don't always matter, and they would rather take someone with Amazon leadership qualities than a person with certificates and degrees that doesn't have Amazon leadership qualities. This is honestly the truth, and you'll see it a lot in certain areas. Many, many people started off as temps and all converted to blue badge, for some roles that people go to school to get degrees in tech, engineering, and even the financial/purchasing side of Amazon.

People have this thought that AWS is just a bunch of geeks sitting around in cubicles programming, but that is the furthest from the truth. While it's part of it, you have our ever-expanding data centers that are looking for people to fill our engineering tech roles, our data tech roles, the physical cabling and networking infrastructure, logistics, and many other areas.

All of those roles I just mentioned you can get into without a degree (with maybe the exception of engineering; most of the guys in engineering that i've met were actually techs for nuclear subs in the US Navy, so that should give you some perspective as to who is filling those roles, but it's not impossible) or experience. Obviously you should have a general level of knowledge (for example... if you want to be a data tech, you should have basic fundamental knowledge of what a CPU is, motherboard, RAM, PSU, what is POST, very basic knowledge of Linux.

That's just an example. All of these roles have people that are experts at their job and they/we are always willing to teach people who have the aptitude to excel.

When and if you get into any of these positions, you'll start to rub shoulders with people in other more traditional ""corporate"" jobs, that can indefinitely lead you to a cubicle or desk in a giant glass box, if that's your ultimate goal.

tl;dr because I know this is a bit of a winded post- AWS is expansive, and you have many options that will help you in going down the corporate path, via avenues that aren't traditionally corporate roles. You will acquire in immense amount of knowledge that you cannot find anywhere else, so don't overlook roles that might not sound appealing to you, because I can 100% guarantee you there is so much opportunity to cross-train and rub shoulders with people in other departments that you can eventually laterally transfer into.",0,t1_ffs8p7i,t2_11p1ke,ffsekfr,t3_eutqpu,t5_1387r9,1580179805,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If you were qualified for an L5 AM role, it would likely have been offered to get the talent in the door.  An L4 is a developmental management role that you'll likely be in for 12-18 months before a promotion to an L5 AM role.  If you are awesome, promotion can come sooner.  Another 18 months after that is about on track for a possible L6 promotion.

External L6 is rare, but if you have the right experience and interview well, it's a possibility.  That said, even with your own business for 3 years, you're not at the right experience level for L6.  Especially when it comes to OMs, Amazon is looking for people with extensive experience leading large teams (150+ people) and development of junior managers. Individual contributor roles are slightly different and require specialized degrees, training, and/or experience.

Finally, Amazon FCs are an incredibly dynamic, fast-paced environment.  If you aren't dedicated and a quick learner with extensive and diverse exoerience, you will get crushed as an OM.  I won't tell you not to apply, but I will say that L4 is a great way to start learning Amazon and advancement comes quickly for those that show aptitude.",0,t3_esk6q8,t2_fwza6,ffsmdwj,t3_esk6q8,t5_1387r9,1580185372,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Do not stress about conversion. Most buildings hold an 80/20. Meaning 80% blue badge and 20% white badge. Not ALL buildings but most. Why? To backfill for attrition. It’s benchmarking season at Amazon. Continue to work hard in your path and show your dedication to your AM’s if you’re looking to stay/develop. 

Benchmarking season means we’re looking to increase department rates/overall performance/safety, look for top TOT offenders and cross train. Your peers may decide to quit or be terminated for safety/quality or behavioral (TOT). If this is the case, you’re considered firsthand to backfill the attrition.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Peak season is over, staffing is being reduced for the large amount of seasonal that they used for peak.  The only individuals not getting VTO is probably ICQA and problem solve areas.  Damaged items being returned have to be disposed of or donated because they are losses that they can not sell.  

Inventory is being done which is part of the VTO being done as well till the end of January.  Februaray starts a new selling season (Valenties day) which will go into March April, (Easter) then April, May, June (Mothers/Fathers day) leading to Inventory again to gear up for Prime Week.

January is probably the biggest month for VTO.  September kicks of back to school, October starts the beginning of the Holidays which runs into November and its Peak time again before you know it.

Now is the time to take vacations, time off if you can and time off during the summer if you can.  Back to school means back to work and hiring will begin again.",0,t3_etism0,t2_4bynqqtj,ffv6840,t3_etism0,t5_1387r9,1580256653,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"When I worked at a Part Time Sortation Center, there were no MET days; instead we were told that on any day (without notice) we could ""flex up"" to a 5 hour shift, or ""flex down"" to a 3 hour shift (commonly referred to as ""three and out""). You still only worked the shifts you were assigned, but could not opt-out if they decided to go 5 hours (unless you're willing to give up UPT).

Random aside - I always wondered why people would cheer and celebrate when they would announce three-and-out at stand-up. Like, why did you bother driving all the way here just to work 3 hours?

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You're already doing fine, so when Learning is looking for Ambassadors, let your AM know, and you should be able to get in relatively easily. Ambassadors can be pulled at any point, so if you are noticing major issues, bring it up with your AM and let your thoughts be known. 

I would place more importance on other things, like problem-solve, if your goal is to move up. Being in outbound gives you more of an advantage over inbound as well, just based on how much more overlap there is with OB problem-solve, as well as general complexity between the different PS roles there are in the building. 

If you're good with computers and have an aptitude for logical processes, let your AM know you want to do PS as well. If that isn't your forte, then perhaps going the route of Ambassador and away-teams is your path (PS will be given the opportunity to attend as well). Not having an aptitude for computers and the logical processes that go along with the multitude of software tools you'd use isn't a make or break thing. Plenty of AM's have exceedingly strong interpersonal skills and might lack in the tech department. Likewise, and something I really hate, you have people who are exceptionally gifted with academic intellect, but have utterly shit people skills. If you have a combination of both, then all the better.",0,t3_evly93,t2_11p1ke,ffwno4z,t3_evly93,t5_1387r9,1580306446,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"As a former FC leader, my assumption is that the leadership retreat is Amazon's annual talent review meeting where every salaried manager is ranked based on their performance and their team's performance.  Managers DO NOT receive any bonus or compensation for their performance; however, it is used to identify changes in leadership structure that may be required to support the operations including:

1) Moving a manager to a different shift or department

2) Moving a manager to a different facility, such as to help open a new location

3) Establish performance improvement plans for managers who are deficient in skills or who are not otherwise meeting expectations

Generally Amazon does not make immediate moves or changes in leadership after this meeting, but it regularly in March and April.  From my experience about 50% of Amazon leaders change positions each year, in part due to the outcome of these discussions.",0,t3_ew8bdk,t2_5i45kf7k,fg2ybrc,t3_ew8bdk,t5_1387r9,1580461417,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Applying through the monthly HITS (hourly internal transfer system) process for facilities in the IND area (IND1, IND2, IND5, etc.) is one option to transfer.  Assuming you didn't apply in January, the next application process is posted Feb 1 - 24th and the transfer would be effective in March.  However, this isn't the only way to transfer if you're seeking to move to a different city.  If you haven't discussed with HR, I would ask them to submit a hardship transfer on your behalf to the IND area.  HR will then communicate with their partners at the other FC who may be able to help you transfer quicker.  

These city-to-city hardship transfers are fairly common, with HR at each FC handling a couple per month.  As a result, I strongly encourage you to ask the HR at your DEN site for help!   
 Ultimately Amazon would rather keep you as an employee and is usually willing to offer more personalized help for city-to-city moves than they do for shift/department transfers within the same building.",0,t3_eve50s,t2_5i45kf7k,fg2z0so,t3_eve50s,t5_1387r9,1580462402,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"I am a former Amazon manager with 8 years experience, during which time I transferred from Amazon FC to Amazon Corporate.  It is fairly common for FC leaders to move to corporate roles and most hiring managers in corporate have a natural bias supporting internal candidates.  You are eligible to transfer at any point, in theory as early as your 2nd day; although I would encourage you to work at least 1 year in an FC to get the full experience.  

To transfer, you will need to apply for positions that you are interested in via Amazon's internal job site JobFinder.  Applications are directed to the HR recruiter.  To improve your chance of being interviewed, you should also email the hiring manager to introduce yourself and ask for an informational interview.  This goes a long way to establishing trust and it will help you ensure the role is the right fit for you!  Although it should go without saying, one caveat on FC to Corporate transfers is that you must have the right skills to match the new position.  It would be difficult to apply for a Director of Marketing role in corporate if your only prior experience is FC operations; however, there are lots of roles in corporate that align with FC operations such as project management, process engineering, or supply chain management.",0,t3_eutqpu,t2_5i45kf7k,fg2zctp,t3_eutqpu,t5_1387r9,1580462875,URL not found

You can always use the jobfinder and look for yourself. Try out career choice and find something that fits your interest. Apply to different roles in the building. Nothing that you see that tickles your fancy? Check nearby buildings. I work in a legacy building that's been around for many years and we always have opportunities popping up for everything from IT to HR to engineering and all sorts of indirect roles. Sometimes there's stagnant roles like PA that have a super low turnover but even so, there will always be people moving up the chain or quitting/terminated to open up spots for many different things.

It seems you should find out what you want to do as well. Regardless of your choice, make sure to use ALL the resources at your disposal while at Amazon.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Mine does. You seriously have to know which HR person to talk to or you will be in limbo with issues other than getting PTO/UPT back.

Case in point. Our FC offered a $100 bonus for anyone not using PTO/UPT during the week that Christmas fell on. This was announced on the 2nd day of my 4 day shift (then 5 because peak). I did not use any time because I wanted the extra money. 

It took about a month and people are finally getting their money but I have not gotten mine, even though I should have. I went to HR 3 or 4 times and the 3rd time, I found out that some of my time for that week was coded as being excused (I had school accommodations that week and had to constantly get my time corrected by HR, as UPT was constantly being taken).

I still don't know if I'll get what I rightfully earned. They can be pretty incompetent.",0,t1_fg14rcz,t2_g624g,fg4i0o2,t3_ew36o0,t5_1387r9,1580503652,URL not found

Process guides, simply put, are the direct link from the managers, problem solve, and the dock to the operations on the line (the sorters and stowers). It’s a process guides job to aid in the logistical “process” of the backend by providing insight to the line about current conditions (like which sections are getting hit the hardest, and reassigning stowers to different areas to address volume if needed). It’s also a process guides job to locate and correct missorts and dwells, as well as transport packages in between lines that may have been sent down the wrong conveyer or that may have gotten seriously damaged and need to get to problem solve.

Here, associates unload trucks, build pallets, stow RSR pallets into the VNA racks or wide aisles, and if your site is a decant site, they open boxes and place the units into yellow totes. 
Rebin is a process in sort in which associates will grab items that are inducted into trays, and place them into the corresponding chutes in walls. Rebin is in AFE, which is OB.",0,t3_ex4nys,t2_4unx5he4,fg66t6b,t3_ex4nys,t5_1387r9,1580556610,URL not found

They train new hires, and are someone that is expected to be able to answer any questions, solve problems, and communicate with managers.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I’ve generally noticed that Amazon places little value on prior education or career when assessing internal candidates.  The college degree requirement for AM positions is considered a minimum ticket to entry unless you have two years of Amazon experience, but by no means does it make you a viable candidate without Amazon-specific results you can discuss to demonstrate your readiness yo lead.  For both PA and AM positions it is important that you already are acting like a leader.  Your AM will probably tell you the best way to do this is by becoming an Ambassador, Water Spider, or Process Guide although these definitely are not requirements.  I have also seen people get inclined based on their involvement in the Safety or Activities Committee, by learning new skills (Problem Solver), and most importantly by taking positive action to serve as a role model on the team.  Without these, you are unlikely to get an interview if 100 people apply and there only are 4-5 PA or AM positions open.

Can’t stress this enough...positive attitude matters!  Your site leadership informally can influence your application.  They are more likely to help if you’re optimistic and enjoyable, while less likely if their interactions are negative or frustrating even if your qualifications are stronger.  Ultimately you will be leading other associates and need to demonstrate that you would bring the right attitude to your team.",0,t3_ex2p6f,t2_5i45kf7k,fg6xzh5,t3_ex2p6f,t5_1387r9,1580579482,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Good response. This makes more sense than what my AM said. Sadly, I was declined to interview for PA (email reasons don't make sense though). My guess is chances at AM are almost zero. I was told I can apply for AM externally and have a better chance since they evaluate you differently. Most of the AMs I've met got in right out of college. I feel like I won't make it anywhere here internally. I've been volunteering in other departments, helping out whenever needed with extra tasks, even helped fix a few tech issues with stations (if computer wasn't needed). I'm supposed to be going to the next Amnesty class soon. Maybe something good could come out of that. Seems like though PA / AM doesn't trust me learning and attempting leadership even though my teammates like me and will listen to me. That's why I have trouble gaining experience. Plus, some teams have their ""favorites"" that they want doing things regularly instead of new people. I just can't afford to waste my education.",0,t1_fg6xzh5,t2_11ls3u,fg6ysve,t3_ex2p6f,t5_1387r9,1580580019,URL not found

Also factor in the refilling of the carts, fixing dunnage, packers with andons (asking for tape or hazard stickers),getting palets, and also possibly an awful handoff from the previous shift.

And to answer one posters question about being on the front side to refill. We have to be on the front to refill big boxes which is necessary if we dont want to have a late break or lunch.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Although this shouldn’t be the case, I have noticed that a lot of AMs and other Amazon leaders are afraid to be honest and transparent about the process for PA and AM interviews.  Each site is a little different in process, but generally there is some form of a scorecard used to evaluate applications where they give weight to different experiences listed on your resume like having a college degree, prior leadership experience, being an Ambassador, etc.  If you have any leaders at your site that you know have your back or who can be trusted to tell it as it is, I would definitely reach out asking for advice on how you can improve your odds of being selected.  They can also fight for you behind the scenes if HR incorrectly screened your application, since HR typically makes the decision on who gets interviewed based on their review of applications versus the scorecard.",0,t1_fg6ysve,t2_5i45kf7k,fg8zwgd,t3_ex2p6f,t5_1387r9,1580632371,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I could try to reach out to a few AMs I know. Sadly, I know my time at amazon is limited (since October 2019), but I managed to do so much in that short timeframe. Plus, I volunteered when asked to work in other departments during peak. It's just that for a low level position (III), you'd think that having a degree, being owner of a company for 10 months, and leadership in leading teams in college through project management would be more than qualified. Plus, I understand how stow works and how rates are evaluated and handling FUD, putbacks, addbacks,  and other terms. I just had higher hopes I guess for tier 3. My guess is my stow rate and a few exemptions from being written up kept me out of the running. I'm not a great stower but I try. I'm mostly good at things with my mind. It's my past job experience (software engineering) and I've mostly been in academics. Amazon is my first real physical job. My body is used to the labor and schedule, but being a twig doesnt help when it comes to stowing. I usually get a bad mix of items.  I try the best I can and people kept telling me to try for other things because I'm educated and have leadership and business experience so I dont waste what I know.

Now I'm always getting bothered by DSP drivers and I can't help them really.

Although, im confused on why you didn't use vacation time to cover the missed day if you had 20 hours. In my experience, HR would cover UPT usage with vacation period unless its a blackout. Also, your acronym usage is confusing. Its PTO for paid time off, VTO is something different, and may result in others being mislead into thinking that too much VTO can get them fired.

fwiw, it sounds like DS stowing is probably a little tougher because of the constant rearranging and closing out the bags, but I've only worked in SC, DS, and an XL-DS, never been in an FC yet, so I'm biased.

I can only go off what I've read in reddit posts and a little video I watched months ago about FC stowing.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"The Stow department in an Amazon Robotics FC is either the most loved or most hated area of the building, largely depending on the type of person you are at work.  The stow team usually has three jobs and typically you will get the chance to rotate each week through at least 2 of 3 after you demonstrate you can master the basics of stow.  Be sure to tell your manager that you want to rotate though, as some people just want to stow.

Role 1 - Stowing (approx 67% of team):  Take vendor inventory out of boxes or totes, scan it, then place it into a bin for storage.  The robots automatically move the shelves/pods around bringing you ones with the most empty space.  The role does require squatting for bottom level bins and using a step ladder for top level bins for about 20% of items you’ll stow, as the shelves are about 7 feet tall.  The hardest part is playing tetris to find empty space, as you have to be good at identifying which item can fit in each bin size.

Role 2 - Waterspider (approx 20% of team):  Move full pallets of inventory from the inbound dock to the stow stations, then lift boxes/totes weighing up to 50 lbs (most are 10-20 lbs though) onto stations for the stowers.  This role is physically strenuous, but people love it because there is no rate expectation.  Waterspiders also get lots of interactions with Area Managers so it’s a good position if you want to demonstrate you can lead an area in order to become a tier 3.

Role 3 - Problem Solver (approx 13% of team):  Research inbound inventory that could not be processed in stow.  The software is pretty easy to learn.  Most problems are either missing barcode labels, damaged items, inventory that wasn’t received correctly, or helping new stowers who don’t know how to handle everything.  This role is not very physically strenuous, but you need to be quick with computers and good at identifying root cause based on patterns you’ve seen before.

Personally I love stow!  I think it has the 2nd most team interaction in an AR FC, outdone only by ship dock, because the team has multiple roles that support each other.  Some people prefer working in silence at a station by themselves though, and therefore prefer to work elsewhere in the FC.  Stow is also more physically active than packing boxes for example, so if you’re looking to chill at a desk then this isn’t the department for you.  Hope this helps!

comment,AmazonFC,1,"trk id is usually a postal package that is in the wrong building. If you have an SC nearby  and they  belong there, someone(ops manager) needs to put in a ticket to get them back over there, otherwise  they ""worldship"" them to where they need to be

cosmos - special request by customer(example: go into my house and put package in refrigerator)

Amzl- lots of things, usually return to fc. basically it means send it to problem solve, they will figure it out

sideline-package for a business that is closed on Sunday(usually) needs sidelined until Monday. If you don't work the weekend you may not see a lot. We have like 20 gaylords every Sunday, MLK weekend was so bad I had to put them on a trailer for them because our warehouse doesn't have any extra space

I don't think packages that have stickers like this affect stow compliance, otherwise we'd never get close to 100%. Only packages with a legit stow address, like ""J-32-a.1"" or whatever. 100% means every deliverable package in the building has been scanned correctly. Pre-phoenix this was tougher to do, lots of dwelling (looking for unscanned pkgs by that long ass number).

comment,AmazonFC,1,"TrkId’s that are not USPS are usually wrong just TBAs. Just print out a new label and reinduct it. Should be able to get stowed after. AMZL’s also can be duplicate packages. If the status is “On the road” for example do not do anything with it other than put it in the DFC area. Delaying it for example could cause issues with the real one that is out for delivery. Delaying, reinducting and DFC’s do not hurt scan compliance.

A tip I can give you is prioritize damaged packages and any packages for your station that should look like it can go out. DFC packages you can do later.",0,t3_eyys9i,t2_osbj2,fgkfha1,t3_eyys9i,t5_1387r9,1580864333,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"L3 is easy to obtain coming from the outside as the job requirments are low.
If she is really good at her job in wharehouse operations she should apply for a L4 job based on her experience, worst case scenario she will be offeres the L3 job if the panel feels that she has some areas that need improving.
If she has superior studies then she should apply for L5 and worst case scenario she will be offered the L4 position.
That being said a good CV goes a long away.
If she had for example of team of 20 people, she should say she had 50 or more. Amazon wants leaders that had a lot of people under their control as the FC teams are big.
In the panel she should focus on the S.T.A.R method while using the amazon leadership principles applied in real work situations.
Long story short: L3 is nothing. She should go for L4. Good CV. Prepared for panels using the S.T.A.R method applied on amazon leadership principles (google them).",0,t3_ez38oc,t2_4dkz0716,fgl30wb,t3_ez38oc,t5_1387r9,1580880436,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Manager here

With the one day and two day shipping options, sometimes we try to calculate the projected charge our building will get based on market forecasts.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Being an AM at an FC is like juggling. You’re expected at the end of the day to deliver on rates, quality, admin obligations, associate engagement, and updates on projects you’re working on. 

Are your rates performing to where they need to be? If not, why? What are you doing about poor rates? Are associates having station issues? Are associates not following best practices and standard work? Are your PA’s engaged and on the same page on the metrics that are being called out? What are you doing about it?

Is your quality and dpmo metrics in standard? What is the root cause of quality misses? Are your PA’s keeping top offenders in check? 

Are you delivering on your productivity and TOT write ups and conversations? Do associates know rate obligations and break standards? Are you using support teams like HR to provide you the proper verbiage to hold poor performers and late break abusers accountable? 

What’s going on with your CPT’s? Why is there a 5 hour dwelling pod for a CPT due within the next hour? Why are there still 3 hour scanned spoos for the next CPT? Do your problem solvers have enough support to process the volume of items being damaged or missed out? Now you reference your quality metrics from before to find that the top offender doesn’t know to read screen or the exception handling process because their ambassador didn’t do their job correctly so now you have to get with Learning to figure out which particular ambassadors weren’t trained correctly. 

Now your floor ops is calling you out on your sudden dip in rate performance. Now you need to put what you’re doing to a halt, double check what’s getting called out and figure out where the miss is. Are your critics inputs ( tray count, packables per wall, water spider blue lights, wall balance, etc) in standard? 

Now half the shift is over and your floor ops is asking if all the associates that need to go to lunar landing towards end of shift have been notified. You remember that you VTO’d half of outbound so now you need to come up with the list of people on where there are, which people on the list for VTO’d that won’t be attending, and figuring out where the class is going to be held. 

PA’s are sending you associates to get VTO’d but you have to step off the floor to deal with an HR termination and your AM counterpart is nowhere in sight because they got pulled off to do something else. 

Now shift is over and you have to spend the next hour coming up with why your associates didn’t make rate or why some associates had a productivity write up miss. Hopefully you delegated you’re CPT misses and action items from today to a CPT chaser because now you need to dig through the CPT miss metrics and calculate what was missed on an excel spreadsheet when it’s been years since you’ve used excel except for that one time in college. Hopefully you took notes throughout the shift of all the trouble tickets of IT and RME issues to help bridge your rate performance decrease. 

Now it’s an hour and a half after shift and you finally get to go home only to do it again tomorrow. Make sure you come one hour prior to start of shift to ensure your counterpart leaves a good hand off. 

So yes, it’s like juggling. Where are you going to drop the ball and how do you recover? This is how a typical day goes for an AM in an FC.",0,t3_ezgh6m,t2_7b2er,fgnpp06,t3_ezgh6m,t5_1387r9,1580950149,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Just to add to this post. sidelines you will only process during friday and saturday system wise, and separate them. sunday you just induct them back into the cycle for monday to go out. 


\- Do inducted and delayed-at-station packages affect our scan compliance?

Inducted packages do affect it along with any package that’s “at station” on comp, this includes damages packages, heavy packages, packages that felt off the belt, missort packages, even the bottom of a bin packages. However, packages that have been debrief, fixit, comp delay. won’t be affecting the SSC. 

\- Do inducted and DFC packages affect our scan compliance?

not sure what you mean by DFC? unless it’s departed for FC in that case no those won’t affect it since ssc only applies to packages that have to be sorted away and since it’s DFC it won’t get a sort location so it can’t be at station. 

\- Any tips other for being efficient?

stay ahead of your workload, should not have more than 20minutes of work for your problem solvers. if you feel overwhelmed talk to p.s learning ambassador. they should request more help. but ideally aim to be on top of your workload. i recommend by multi package processing. so scan 12-17 packages on comp at a time and process as you go. or if you’re fast. separate all your packages before working them, all ready for fc return, WS in another, between FC station in another, double tbas in another. then just process each pile insanely fast. do your rounds so it doesn’t pile up, get your repack out ASAP that is dwelling and does affect SSC. try to save more packages don’t try and FC everything out. makes you look more shrewd.",0,t1_fgk5gtk,t2_n5g5m,fgnxlbu,t3_eyys9i,t5_1387r9,1580955114,URL not found

The other interviewers will typically be assigned leadership principles based on the role.  For this type of position, I would expect them yo focus on Deep Dive, Bias for Action, Deliver Results, Think Big, Insisting on High Standards, and Earning Trust.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Ever been a manager? If you've had prior management experience, then you know a lot of what the job entails. If your team is underperforming and missing goals, then you'll be held accountable for it by your Ops and Senior Ops managers. If other managers suddenly call off, you'll need to cover their shift, in addition to your scheduled responsibilities. You'll work the schedules you're told to work. Can you also effectively handle your team's labor and performance issues? It wouldn't surprise me if an AM worked a 12-hour day, from leaving to returning home. As others have said, it's a good stepping stone for those pursuing Operations careers. Otherwise, it's likely not a good fit, and counterproductive to your career development.

In any leadership position you have to deal with all types of associates with different personalities, you won't be liked by everyone (life!!!). If your goal is to make the best moves to support your team than you will be fine , possible promote sooner than later. Your shift most likely will be 4  12hr shifts . It can be night or day. Usually sun-wed or wed - sat, day shift workers tend to have the better balance. If you are a quick learner than you could be getting out earlier. You are salaried, you don't clock in. If you have something to do let your Ops know and they will usually give you time of w/o using your time.",0,t3_ezy71c,t2_2vn5duh3,fgrj2r2,t3_ezy71c,t5_1387r9,1581048083,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If you are night shift you only work nights, never days and vice versa. As far as overtime on unscheduled VET: If it's staying later or clocking in sooner than 5 minutes you need express permission from your AM before doing it. If it's a whole shift that's permission you need more from the other team running shift. What I mean by that is that the ones running the show Ops Manager and higher are either front half or back half with both shifts overlapping on Wednesday usually they take turns every Wednesday on who ""runs"" the shift. So you coming in on an extra day you're dipping into the other team's expected headcount and assigned hours so your AM or even ops has almost no say in approving you an extra day outside of unapproved vet.",0,t3_ezi8u9,t2_16e5ps2s,fgsrd5j,t3_ezi8u9,t5_1387r9,1581091024,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,Those excel macros are amazing! I've only really gotten into since working at Amazon and love them. I'm barely proficient with excel. Can't make pivot tables or those crazy cool macros that auto pull data even though 95% of what I do requires me using several different ones. I don't have a working laptop at home to practice with so the only extra practice i get is those few spare minutes during shift. I died a little inside when they centralized the DA position and all our DAs had to go elsewhere which means they all basically went to other facilities so now when a macro stops working because some backend url or something was migrated it takes time to get it fixed.,0,t1_fgogcu6,t2_16e5ps2s,fgsstbw,t3_ezgh6m,t5_1387r9,1581091916,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,I am a bit concerned about the fact that you mentioned you are a problem solver and also do FPY reports but still wondering about what an AM does. Nothing against you really. How compartmentalized is your team or site? Usually being a problem solver AND also doing FPY means you have a good grasp of the overall picture and have been exposed to other parts of the process.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Not sure about all sites but at my site it happens when someone takes the vto but decides to still come in or stay and they don't get in trouble. Granted usually there might be a good reason like people that carpool and only one person got to get it in time etc but not without warning because frequently doing this will get them in trouble. Technically they can't clock in because they have volunteered to not work and have taken that spot now so them coming in after taking it means they took that opportunity from someone else. Recently we did call this out to people and it has stopped. As for staying clocked in a few minutes after accepting it, yes you still get paid for the time you were clocked in its illegal to not be paid for any time you were on the clock. It's not a get out of jail free card like ""oh I'll take vto now but really I want to leave in like an hour without using up my time"" you will get caught and called out for that as that is time theft.",0,t3_eyw5pe,t2_16e5ps2s,fgsvzct,t3_eyw5pe,t5_1387r9,1581093797,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Ahh I see the confusion.

The more units processed, the easier it is to make rate. Seems simple but they don't always explain rate very well to associates.

A good example of this: at our FC we have order pickers. Pickers fill cages and drop off when done. The more units stuffed into the cages every time = a much easier time making rate even when drop off times can be 5+ minutes. A 70 unit cage can make up for the time inbetween, but a 30 unit cage barely covers that 5 min.

Throughout the week you want to process as many units possible. Not only does this help with rate a lot but also quality. If you make quality errors you can process your way out of a written warning depending on what the dpmo threshold is for your path. Eg: I had 8 errors last week but because I counted 2000 units, I was safe and under threshold. If I made 8 errors and only counted 1000 I would have a write up.",0,t1_fgu8ncq,t2_fe0ni,fguc3mg,t3_f0fc0e,t5_1387r9,1581117216,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"**I strongly recommend pursuing a medical leave of advance!** Even if you're in good performance standing, resign, and are classified as re-eligible for immediate rehiring, there needs to be open positions available for you to reapply to, assuming you want to return to the same facility and in the same role. **Eligibility for immediate rehiring is not a guarantee of immediate re-employment.** Consider a situation where an FC may have overhired Blue badges, but are committed to keeping them around to train and work in other process paths. Your resignation has just helped the FC lower their overall labor costs and may not immediately need you, meaning you'll be waiting around until there are new job postings available in which to apply.

Please login to a computer and while on the Hub (AtoZ), click **Resources** (bottom lower-right hand corner of the screen), then click **Learn about my leave options**, and take the necessary steps. When you're on a leave of absence, you will have a legal, contractual right to return to work at the end of your leave. A resignation and re-apply is risky because there needs to be open jobs for which you can apply to. And while you may be prioritized for a job opening and be ""ahead of the line,"" it's still not a guarantee you'll be coming back. Also on the **Resources** page, there's a link to **Employment Policies**, which after clicking, scroll down to **US FC Policies**, there's a link for **Rehire Eligibility NAFC**. Take some time to read that as well as it's better to read the policies yourself then primarily relying on the Internet to interpret these really important decisions for you.",0,t3_f0c884,t2_5dt6788f,fguv4p5,t3_f0c884,t5_1387r9,1581130112,URL not found

Lastly, try to talk to whomever is the PA or the water spider and see if you can possibly get a few small boxes.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I’m guessing you’re not using the new nike stow stations? 

Rates and tak time are weighted against your bin size average.

So if you have an unusually high volume of med/large items that is taken into account when calculating your rate and tak time. 

A pointer I gave all my associates when I was a stow PA, it’s always better to stow 1 item, even if it takes you a full minute than to do a no stow turn away. 

Keep a good variety of item sizes. Try to keep signed into 1 case of 6”, and 12” items always to help keep a better flow of pods. 

When you get those awesome items don’t just go nuts and crush through a large quantity of smalls just because you can. Stow a few of them then switch to something else.

Does taking personal LOA's for whatsoever reasons make upper management angry and effect our promotion prospects? Or is it something that Area Managers usually do?",0,t1_fgzy1yg,t2_5mx1bjcv,fh0qorz,t3_f0vaon,t5_1387r9,1581206550,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Blackout periods for personal LOAs are the same as the vacation blackout periods, which usually occur during the week of Prime Day and between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

My advice is that you speak to your manager prior to taking a personal LOA.  As an AM, you can damage trust if you take one by calling the ERC without notifying your direct manager.  I have seen multiple AMs burn bridges by taking an LOA, but upper management was mostly offended by how they went about it (trying to be as secretive and shady about it as possible).  People understand that life happens if you act in a trustworthy manner about it when taking the LOA, especially if you typically pull your full weight with the team when you are at work.",0,t1_fh0qorz,t2_5i45kf7k,fh1ok75,t3_f0vaon,t5_1387r9,1581219722,URL not found

As far as resignation, you will typically receive a letter in the mail from corporate HR confirming your resignation.  It took about two weeks after my last day to receive the letter.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Tip 1: Stow from your power zone

That's it!

Honestly it's easy. What some people dont tell you is that you can stow without using the stair at all. In one whole day I would only use the stair like 4 times. Especially if you know if you're going to have good items all day (depending on what side you're on). You don't necessarily have to have good items to get a good tak time. I average like withint a whole week like 10 second tak time. My productivity is always over a 100%. Basically worse case scenario if you have to use the stair to stow multiple items in an empty pod just do it.",0,t3_f0m1hs,t2_167al5,fh2km42,t3_f0m1hs,t5_1387r9,1581256180,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"Unless you've gone through a formal interview process or loop for a position, your level remains the same. 

Where you are within Amazon will play a large role in terms of what level you are. Each role has a leveling guideline, and your level will be based on those guidelines. 

As it relates to the FC; L1-3 is just a general associate; L4-6 is general management; L7 is Sr. Management; L8 is Direction or GM and L10 is VP and L11 is S-Team/direct reports to Jeff Bezos, with Jeff Bezos being the only L12. 

Why is there no L9? Probably to reflect the blast radius an L8 has compared to L10. At L10 your impact is industry and brand wide. The difference between L8 and L10 is site/region vs global decision making. Having L9 would technically speaking probably make it easier to enter into the VP world by having another rung in the ladder to climb. Amazon sets the bar exceptionally high (in most cases....), so removing that rung would essentially make it more difficult for those climbing *internally*",0,t3_f200q1,t2_11p1ke,fhb12ha,t3_f200q1,t5_1387r9,1581432334,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"I wouldn't look at things like that. Will OT suck ass as management? Yes; but you guys need to look at the amount of opportunity that's within Amazon, and not just in your single FC. As L4, 5, 6, you have many options in terms of where you want to go. We have multiple subsidiaries, multiple different sectors of work, and all of them are available to you (unless of course it's something exceptionally specific, like software development or something). 

Don't pass up the opportunity to promote simply based off how much OT sucks.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"If you have a bachelors in engineering and computer science, you have a very good chance of landing many positions. 

The only downside is that as an internal candidate, it will be more difficult. Skipping levels is the only part that's difficult, but if they're going to consider you, then run with it.

The BEST thing you could do is reach out to the hiring manager directly and begin a dialogue with them. 

I recently had to take a class and there was an L7 Sr. Manager for Software Development Engineering attending; I got to talk with him and he was an extremely approachable guy. If it were my area of study, I would feel as though I had no problem directly messaging him, and that he'd be receptive of my outreach. 

The long and short of it is this; if you see a position you want to apply for, just apply for it, and reach out to the hiring manager directly on Chime. If you don't have Chime, go talk to your IT and request your email be powered up so you can access it and have these conversations. 

On that note, if you do get rejected, don't take the rejection too hard. Internally climbing can be difficult. If this is the case, enjoy your time in the FC. You may not think it now, but you will obtain invaluable knowledge and a base level of understanding of Amazon that a lot of people don't get at the higher levels of Amazon, along with that will come appreciation for what it's like to be T1 in the FC. 

You can climb, easily, sometimes it just takes patience.",0,t1_fh254la,t2_11p1ke,fhb31zk,t3_f0ni3e,t5_1387r9,1581433680,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"You can have an 1-on-1 with your GM any time honestly, a side objective for all of Operations is the development of their associates. You can speak with HR to request a 1-on-1 with your site leader and just let them know you want to talk to them about career development and that you have a degree, and you just want guidance and to start a dialogue with them. Favoritism is not something that is used as a tool or weapon to stop someone from reaching out to and becoming familiar with the hiring manager. 

As for corporate software engineering positions, I wouldn't pay attention to much to what they say the requirements are. 

Chris Vonderhaar, our VP, has himself said that they would rather hire and promote people that exemplify Amazon's leadership values over someone who exemplifies technical qualifications, but lacks in certain leadership values. 

That much is very true, and I see it in interview debriefs where candidates who do have an education and decent level of technical knowledge are preferred over people who far exceed the qualifications, but are severely lacking in the character department. 

A good portion of the interview process pertains to *you* and the leadership principles. 

There are plenty of people within those technical roles that are more than willing to take you under their wing and expand on your current level of knowledge. So do not be afraid of applying for positions. I don't want to get your hopes up too much, because it is still a competitive process, but I would say that since you're an internal hire now, you need to start having mock interviews with your AM and L6 OM, and take to heart the feedback they give you regarding *how* to interview and focus on the leadership principles. As long as you're able to show people you aren't clueless for a technical interview, you should be fine. 

Lastly, this also isn't to say that you won't get a complete asshole(s) for your hiring manager who only cares about credentials, and couldn't care less about leadership principles, even though that goes against the very fabric of the hiring process. 


tl;dr - do not be afraid to have a 1-on-1 with your site leader and just let them know you want to move up, career development, and your education/degree(s) (this is quite literally part of what it is to be Operations, as Ops you should be developing your associates that wish to move up). Don't be afraid to apply for positions that say you need x-years of experience; also on that note, don't be afraid to take other positions that work alongside those positions that could help you segue into your preferred role.",0,t1_fhbamjz,t2_11p1ke,fhc2i69,t3_f0ni3e,t5_1387r9,1581454887,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Promotion from L4 to L5 AM is generally feasible in 12-18 months.  It is based on your ability to lead a larger team of associates, begin informally leading peers, and based on your ability to deliver measurable results through team performance, process improvement projects, or by partnering with other teams in the building such as safety or HR to help them achieve goals.

The promotion from L5 AM to L6 Operations Manager requires you to demonstrate different skills than required for the AM role, and therefore promotion timelines vary quite a bit.  I have seen people promoted from L5 to L6 in under 6 months, but also I’ve seen AMs who haven’t been promoted even with 10 years experience.  L6 requires that you demonstrate consistent maturity, team work, and that you role model most leadership principles.  AMs that act unprofessionally, such as taking days off with no advanced notice or those that get complaints about them for favoritism, inappropriate comments, etc are unlikely to ever get promoted.  Additionally you need to demonstrate that you regularly take action ON YOUR OWN to improve the business.  This could be anything from improving safety/quality/productivity to helping other shifts improve results to taking an active role in mentoring other AMs.  You must also be comfortable providing upwards feedback to L6 and L7 managers.  For some people all of this comes naturally and they get promoted from L5 to L6 quick, but not everyone is prepared mentally to demonstrate consistent maturity and therefore they remain an AM.

My advice for both levels of promotion is to seek tough feedback from managers on how to improve.  Not every mentor gives honest or actionable feedback, so you should reach out to multiple people in order to get diverse perspectives on your performance.  Amazon requires 4-5 managers above you to write a document supporting your promotion so it isn’t enough to have only your direct manager advocate for you.  The better you build a network the more likely you will be promoted!",0,t3_f1le6y,t2_5i45kf7k,fhc8h6h,t3_f1le6y,t5_1387r9,1581458309,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It's the same most of all Amazon, most roles are starting at L3 (or for some L2, but mostly to occomodate for someone they want to take on who will be delegated to and guided) and as an Individual Contributor role can climb to L5 (some, very few, could be L6 or higher I suppose, but I don't use the few exceptionally high level IC roles as a standard), while management for most teams start at L4 at the bottom level.

If the team or org covers far more high levels of confidentiality, or other reasons, some orgs might *just* have an L6 HR Business Partner, or some might not have any IT at all, but the IC's who work there might act as local IT.

Likewise, L7 and above is nearly always Senior management, or those who are in charge of steering sites, data center clusters, senior positions to other managers.

The long as short is that there is a theme regarding the leveling guidelines. 

You could ask your HR or manager for the ""general leveling guidelines"" so you can have a really good understanding of what the guidelines are, and then when you think about what type of blast radius and responsibilities are expected of an L3, it'll all make much more sense to you when you're thinking of HR reps, and your local IT tech.",0,t1_fhcr3sl,t2_11p1ke,fhd60f9,t3_f200q1,t5_1387r9,1581478056,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"There are typically 3 sections to the typical tier 3 interview, each of which can be practiced to help improve your execution during the interview:

1) Math/Process Flow Problem:  You will be given a printed copy of a scenario which requires calculating how long it takes to manufacture an item based on the time required to complete each step.  I believe these scenarios are leaked on glassdoor.com.  Although answering the math calculation correctly is important, the candidates that crush this interview scenario demonstrate that they think bigger about the process.  A couple tips you should be sure to discuss:

1A:  What step in the process is the bottleneck?  This can be determined by calculating how many wigits each step can produce per hour.  If steps 1, 2, and 4 can make 100 units/hour but step 3 can only produce 50 units/hour then step 3 is the bottleneck.  You could increase the capacity of the process by fixing step 3 to produce more units, given that every other step has surplus capacity.  One option could be to add 2x people to this step by reallocating labor, but you also could suggest ideas for how to make things work better (change process sequence, change layout of work area &amp; materials, etc.).  It is a hypothetical situation, so the interviewer is interested to see how you think.  It’s better to be a little creative!

1B:  What do you think of the process or business in it’s current state?  Could process be improved such as by rearranging/combining steps, changing sequence of events to avoid time that product waits, etc?  Also could anything else be improved, such as by reducing variations to improve quality or reducing the number of employees involved to improve customer service?  

1C:  What could the business do better?  Again, think creative and demonstrate your ability to think big.  Most people score poorly because they only focus on the math part of this problem, but it also is a stealth critical thinking exercise.


2) Associate Role Play:  You will be asked to coach the interviewer on something, practicing as if they were an associate.  A typical scenario is an associate is slow in the morning &amp; then they rush in the afternoon to meet their quota.  This creates multiple things you could talk about:
- Safety risk from not maintaining a steady pace
- Risk of quality errors from rushing
- Showing empathy by asking them how things are going in their life, trying to understand root cause of slow pace in morning

Most important for #2 is giving actionable, time bound advice.  For example, you could teach them a tip and ask them to implement it today and you’ll check how they did at lunch.  I would focus on tips that you actually believe in, as you need to show you are an upbeat optimistic leader.

3)  Situational Interview Questions:  You will be asked 4-5 interview questions that require you to tell a story in STAR format (situation, task, action taken, result).  Your answers do not need to only be about Amazon; although at least 1-2 should discuss action in your current role.  The key question typically focus on:

3A) Situation where you delivered a measurable improvement in your job, especially when it had an impact on the whole team/business instead of you as an individual.

3B). Situation where you demonstrated Bias for Action to take care of a situation, preferably without specific guidance from your manager.

3C). Situation where you developed other individuals in their performance.

There are many variations on the questions, but most of Amazon’s interview question bank is posted on glassdoor.com.

If you have time before your interview, ask a manager to conduct a mock interview with you!  Most are willing to help and want to see you succeed (otherwise you probably would have been declined for an interview).",0,t3_f2me75,t2_5i45kf7k,fhdlfil,t3_f2me75,t5_1387r9,1581490387,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"I agree with most other comments on Pack Singles being preferable to Stow.  One downside is the lack of indirect roles compared to stow.  If you like problem solving, stow typically has about 1 problem solver for every 10-12 associates vs. a 1 to 20 ratio in pack.  Stow also has about 1/3 of associates in indirect roles like waterspider, while pack singles will only have maybe 2-3 associates helping with restocking corrugate and removing empty totes.  As a result you will work in Pack more often than you might do the direct Stow role (although it is still worth it to avoid squatting &amp; using a step ladder)!",0,t3_f2j1pw,t2_5i45kf7k,fhdm75e,t3_f2j1pw,t5_1387r9,1581491236,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"The ERC can usually approve an unpaid personal leave quickly to excuse time, but you have to take at least one week off to be eligible.  You may have heard LOA horror stories, but usually the slow approval is for government mandated programs like FMLA where Amazon has to be more careful to execute it correctly.  You don’t need a good excuse for a personal leave either, as I’ve seen coworkers take it to travel, go camping, etc.

As far as justification to get a single day excused, HR is very inconsistent.  Generally your best bets are to tell HR you have a transportation issue (you carpool and someone else’s car broke down), you had a child care issue (babysitter unexpectedly did not show), or a family emergency (get someone to call the building’s phone number, ask to speak to you or HR, and state you need to leave due to a situation).",0,t3_f2mfg3,t2_5i45kf7k,fhdmoao,t3_f2mfg3,t5_1387r9,1581491778,URL not found

Don't be afraid to speak candidly either. Whether it's a VP or your GM, they're still normal people and want you to succeed. You're doing more than most people as T1 ever will, so it's a step in the right direction.

You shouldn't feel like you're wasting your education either. When you do land your preferred job, your time in the FC will help you greatly, trust me. So many software devs and other higher ups are beyond clueless sometimes because they have never experienced what it's like to use their shitty apps actually on the ground floor of Amazon.

comment,AmazonFC,1,"It's always ok to do what's best for you, but you may get blacklisted for future jobs with Amazon if you burn bridges with the hiring manager.

I won't lie, there is no such thing as a 40 hour work week for college hires looking to advance quickly in almost any industry.   There are always going to be people willing to work harder/longer hours.  Amazon is just very upfront about it.

Amazon is a difficult place to work, but the benefit is fast progression and limitless advancement opportunity for those that can adapt and thrive within the culture.

Honestly, I'd take the job, test drive it for 6 months while continuing to look, and then move on if you end up hating it.  There is high turnover, but the grass isn't necessarily greener, and this way you'll have the benefit of a management position in a top ranked Fortune 500 company on your resume which you may find opens previously closed doors.",0,t1_fheacyb,t2_fwza6,fhf868q,t3_ezy71c,t5_1387r9,1581538177,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Just going to have to work your way up man, honestly. As an internal candidate it will take time, but there are also advantages to being internal. Say you're problem solve trained and you notice there's a faster way of creating a certain type of ticket that managers cut often. Develop a script that could automate it. There's a guy in AWS who was in Logistics, started making custom scripts for their team, and it became adopted globally by their org. He got a business title change and that would help him move into other positions if he wanted.


If I had that skill set, that's what I'd be looking at. 

If you have that skill set, see how you can improve on processes where you work, and use whatever headway you make as a means.

Also, applying early on when a position is posted will help you. They can't scroll to the 50th person who applied and interview them all.

I mean it when I say that experience is not everything. 

Techs in a data center can get hired with ZERO experience, but they requir general knowledge. 

If you have a good base skill set, just apply. 

It sounds like a cliche, ""just apply,"" but it's the honest to goodness truth half the time.

You really really don't need a ton of experience or internships and all that shit. 

Practice interviewing, and strengthen your understanding of Amazon leadership principles and how you exemplify them in your day to day work.

Again it's not a cliche, they will pay close attention to how you exemplify the leadership traits, and it plays a huge part in the selection process.

A lot of the managers (not all) were virtually useless. They would see you struggle to control blue light and would just walk past leaving you alone to do the work of 3 or 4 people.

Then they would bounce us from injecting to transpo to loading trucks to scanning packages to carts to waterspider, all the while the laziest most useless blue badge employees (not all) would stand there talking, laughing and collecting a paycheck for doing absolutely nothing bc they knew their job was secure. 

Meanwhile they worked seasonal employees like dogs and we were (unfortunately) willing to do anything/everything they asked bc conversion was on our minds. We wanted that blue badge and we wanted to show we were the best. Only to get let go and immediately rehired

comment,AmazonFC,1,I'm just trying to figure out what scam Amazon has going on. You know you are understaffed and struggling to keep up with workflow. Why give people their termination papers just to rehire them 14 days later?? It makes absolutely no sense.,0,t1_fhhw1b5,t2_40miwe0v,fhhxpzw,t3_f3c5ze,t5_1387r9,1581613820,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,I feel promises to employees should be as important as the customer promise but there is a weak link in the chain,0,t3_etism0,t2_3b5rzkcw,fhhye5q,t3_etism0,t5_1387r9,1581614201,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,It's not a scam. Temporary labor is temporary labor for a reason. It is expendable. The operations team has a budget to meet. If that budget doesn't allow for 2 weeks worth of extra temporary labor then they will end the assignment until the budget allows for it,0,t1_fhhxpzw,t2_2ag6os1t,fhi0oi7,t3_f3c5ze,t5_1387r9,1581615502,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,Scam. You're right. At the end of the day it makes sense to them somewhere profit wise. They don't give a damn about us.,0,t1_fhhxpzw,t2_13pltyin,fhi0wif,t3_f3c5ze,t5_1387r9,1581615628,URL not found

comment,AmazonFC,1,"IMO, the offer isn't worth it. It's based on how long you've been there. It gets taxed. Most times won't cover a month of living expenses. I believe it's $2k if you've been there a year. And you'll never be allowed to work for Amazon and it's subsidiaries (Zappos, audible, whole foods, Twitch, and like a two dozen other companies).

If you're burnt out, I suggest just re-signing and having the possibility of working for Amazon again in the back burner in case things don't work out. Pays decent enough to live off of and easy to get rehired.",0,t3_f3d0n4,t2_2yi1lxy0,fhi295n,t3_f3d0n4,t5_1387r9,1581616386,URL not found
comment,AmazonFC,1,"Usually happens at All Hands. That is when they did it at my FC. But seriously, suck it up. Im on week 5 in a row of 60 hours.
